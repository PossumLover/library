Political violence has never been foreign to the American system, but even against the general background of maniacal killing you sometimes get a <em>crazy year</em>. A crazy year isn’t even necessarily deadlier than other years, just more deranged. In 2020, large swathes of the population were so outraged by the cold-blooded police murder of unarmed black people that, despite having believed only a few days previously that your lungs would cave in like a Coke can in the Mariana Trench if you left your home for any reason whatsoever, they took to the streets. In some places they managed to chase the cops out entirely. These liberated zones were protected by new anti-racist community self-defence groups that almost immediately set about cold-bloodedly murdering unarmed black people. There was just over a month between the killing of George Floyd and the killing of Antonio Mays Jr. It seemed to make sense at the time.</p><p>Somehow, in the middle of all this plague and protest, the country had to hold an election, and in a year of youth revolt the choice ended up being between a fat, senile, rambling old man and a thin, senile, rambling old man. (A third old man was briefly a contender, but he was too cogent to really express the spirit of the age.) When the fat old man lost he refused to accept defeat, and some of his supporters took an unplanned and unguided tour of the Capitol building with the idea that doing so would somehow change the result. One of them was shot dead by police. Two more found it all a bit too exciting; their hearts, clogged with fifty years of trademarked greases, suddenly gave out. One moment they were gibbering through the halls of power, the next they’d died spontaneously on the spot. </p><p>The upshot of this crazy year is that large numbers of people are now convinced that the United States is on its way towards some kind of breakup. Maybe a more or less amicable national divorce, in which Red America and Blue America decide that their differences are irreconcilable and resolve to go their separate ways. The red people can go back to drinking corn juice without having to worry if it’s secretly trying to turn them trans. The blue people will agree to only secretly administer the chemicals that turn you trans to their <em>own</em> children. Or maybe it’ll be a full-on civil war. States against the federal government, cities against the countryside, a guerrilla campaign that widens and widens until the entire country is gurgling on its own blood. </p><p>This is the earnest fantasy of plenty of people on the very online right, but it’s also the opinion of Dr Barbara F Walter (Chicago, UCSD, Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, etc), a scholar of civil conflicts abroad who now thinks something similar is coming to her own country. Resentful rural whites, frothing like a yeast infection to the demagoguery of ‘ethnic entrepreneurs,’ will soon take up a campaign of terror against democratic society, until the whole thing is so riddled with shrapnel holes it simply collapses. Reviewing her book in the <em>LRB</em>, James Meek disagrees. Not that civil war is imminent—he just thinks it’s more likely that the <em>liberal</em> side will be the insurrectionaries. He imagines Donald Trump illegally seizing power in a sham election that’s then rubberstamped by his captive Congress, and the defenders of democracy rising up in an armed revolt against the new regime. The real danger, he writes, isn’t civil war, but the prospect that the right seizes power and ‘most liberals just put up with it, judging it not worth the blood and damage to fight for democracy.’ This scenario has some problems. (Given the last two elections, isn’t it the case now that the losing side <em>always</em> claims the result was illegitimate? How do you tell the difference between an actual sham election and a sham of a sham? Is it really <em>democracy</em> you’d be fighting for, or is it something else?) If that one doesn’t catch your interest, though, there are other models. Just this month we had <em>Civil War</em>, the biggest and flashiest A24 feature to date: Alex Garland’s vision of a future conflict between an implicitly dictatorial federal government and a secessionist alliance of Texas and California. Meanwhile Stephen Marche has <em>five</em> different accounts of how the United States could spiral into civil war. He also thinks the next civil war has already begun. </p><p>The next civil war has not already begun. America is a violent country, armed to the teeth and blistering with hatred, but it’s also old, lazy, stupid,<em> </em>fat, medicated, and cowardly. 2020 marked a recent high point in American political violence, but all that violence was politically meaningless and merely <em>dumb</em>. A clown show, a farce, but this time when the performer falls off the ladder with his head in a bucket of custard, you can really hear his neck snap as he hits the ground. The past decade of polarisation and turmoil has not yet produced a single <em>exchange of fire</em>. There are armed factions, clammy political losers of every stripe, walking around in the streets with their assault rifles, their incomprehensible slogans, and their bellies peeking over their waistbands, but all of them, from the cops to the anarchists to the Nazis, are abject pussies. The most prominent of them call themselves the Boogaloo Boys, because there’s a 1984 film called <em>Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo</em>, and it became an internet meme to append <em>Electric Boogaloo</em> to any sequel, and they’re trying to spark a sequel to the nineteenth-century American Civil War. Also, they wear Hawaiian shirts, because <em>big luau </em>sounds a bit like <em>boogaloo</em>, and wave flags of a blue igloo, because that sounds a bit like <em>boogaloo</em> as well. This is what’s meant to overturn the most powerful empire in human history: some sub-Rickroll meme dogshit. It’s all playing pretend, and they know it. The American way of doing deadly violence involves one man with a gun spraying a bunch of other people without guns, basically at random. If he isn’t a cop he’ll end by turning the gun on himself. One last spastic fit: the only way to really express the frenzy churning away inside you. If you tried to put it in words it wouldn’t make much sense. In other countries, ideological violence is the ultimate means of securing your political objectives; in America it all comes down to the voices in your head.</p><p>There will not be a second American Civil War in our lifetimes. But you <em>want</em> it. Absolutely everyone in America, from the liberals on down, agrees that the ordinary agonistic mode of democratic politics has failed. Your opinions about gender are too different; you can’t agree on whether to say <em>unhoused</em> or <em>homeless</em>: now is the time for force. It’s not going to happen, but you still dream tender dreams about it every night. You imagine your friends and neighbours all being lined up against a wall and shot. You imagine your city in ruins. And as you do, your lips curl up into a beatific smile. This is what we need to understand.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><div><hr></div><p>The Alex Garland film is useful here. Critical consensus says that <em>Civil War</em> is a very nice-looking piece of filmmaking, but it doesn’t have anything to <em>say</em>. All we get are frustrating little hints: ‘Portland Maoists,’ ‘Antifa massacre,’ militiamen in Hawaiian shirts, a President with vaguely Trumpy vibes. Critics have accused Garland of cowardice, or both-sidesism, for failing to adequately signpost things. They wanted a film that unflinchingly points the finger at the right in general and Donald Trump in particular for starting a war that hasn’t actually happened yet. The actual film is weirdly apolitical, maybe even nihilistic, maybe even—given its failure to uphold the side of the righteous—reactionary. My favourite review is in <em>WIRED</em>, where David Gilbert (sadly, not the one from the Weather Underground) brings in an expert to upbraid Garland for saying in an interview that left and right fundamentally refer to different approaches to taxation. ‘This narrowly defined view of the battle between the left and right may be technically accurate but is not based in reality… Right involves rampant white supremacist, patriarchal fascistic power, while left is defined as diversity and inclusion and actual history and science.’</p><p>(Actually, my <em>favourite</em> reviews come from the people—some with very large platforms—who think the film is a form of ‘predictive programming.’ Our shadowy rulers are seeding the culture with images of war and destruction, so when it’s time to make these things a reality our responses will have already been conditioned. The people who believe this sort of thing think they’ve peered through the curtain. They’re not fooled. They see what’s really going on. In fact, they’re so fixed to their screens that they now think everything that happens on the screen is real.)</p><p>As always, even the saner critics have moss growing in the furrows of their brains. <em>Civil War</em> actually says everything that needs saying. In trying to present a gritty, realistic depiction of what a future American Civil War would look like, Garland ends up inadvertently showing exactly why it can’t happen, and exactly what the idea that it <em>might</em> happen is really made of. </p><p>Halfway through the film, our heroes stop for the night somewhere in West Virginia. They’re a team of photojournalists, hoping to get down to Washington DC and interview the President before the city falls. As ribbons of tracer fire flap about the horizon, Kirsten Dunst’s character reflects. ‘Every time I survived a war zone and got the photo,’ she says, ‘I thought I was sending a warning home. <em>Don’t do this</em>. But here we are.’ It’s an unusual way to think of armed conflict: as a terrible but delicious <em>temptation</em>. Except that’s exactly what this war is. </p><p>Remember that our hero is a <em>photographer</em>. On the front lines, snapping pictures as the men around her fight and die. She may as well be a knight on horseback; this kind of journalism <em>does not exist</em> any more. There are several wars going on right now: when was the last time you saw a photo, taken by an accredited and independent war photographer, of direct combat on the front lines of Gaza or Myanmar or Sudan or Ukraine? Nobody needs to let Reuters in their trenches; the armies and guerillas produce it all themselves. Sometimes journalists are <em>embedded</em>, which is just a way for armed forces to produce their own propaganda under someone else’s byline. But the images of war that circulate come from body cams, or terrified civilians filming on their phones, or, increasingly, AI slop-vats. In fact, some of the promotional images for <em>Civil War</em> appear to have been AI-generated: they don’t just show American cities in ruins, but with all their landmarks in the wrong places. This is probably a bad idea for a film about image-makers fearlessly chasing the truth—but our heroes’ real purpose is turn the war into aesthetically pleasing shots. By the end, they’re <em>telling the soldiers what to do</em>, ordering them about for the sake of a better representation. Not very plausible, but the implication is true. The war is only taking place for the benefit of the photographers. It’s all image. It doesn’t exist.</p><p>Look again at the lingering scenes of its effects, which are clearly supposed to be sobering. Tent cities in New York. A dead town in Appalachia, its abandoned mall surrounded by burned-out vehicles, home to packs of stray dogs. Washington DC fortified, scarred with security fences. You see where I’m going with this. That’s just America! That’s just what it looks like over there! This vision of a country that’s been at war with itself for years on end is visually identical with the present. In the climactic final sequence, the rebels storm the capital, and <em>all the lights are still on</em> in Washington. Every one of those boxy midrise office buildings is lit up like a toy shop on Christmas. The war flits over the face of the city like a dream. </p><p>It’s not as if we don’t know what war in the twenty-first century actually looks like. The war in Syria has been going for thirteen years, and it doesn’t look like a few holes in the roof of a JCPenney. It looks like entire cities ground down into grey powder. Every building scrubbed of its patina of human habitation, until all that’s left is the geometry of broken concrete. Dust over everything: a piece of the Earth that’s decided to start resembling the Moon. Meanwhile, the opposing sides in <em>Civil War</em> have apparently made a gentleman’s agreement to settle their differences without artillery. Just small arms: no drones, no MLRS salvoes, no cruise missiles, no loitering munitions, no JDAMs, no cluster bombs, no white phosphorus, no nerve agents, and not one of the United States’ stockpile of 3,708 nuclear warheads. There are some tanks in the final sequence, but they’re only used to blow up targets from a distance of about a hundred metres. In the actual war in Ukraine, meanwhile, tanks are almost exclusively used as mobile artillery, firing at distant targets spotted by consumer drones, on vectors calculated with mobile apps. This is how real conflicts are fought, but <em>Civil War</em> is a representation of a <em>fantasy</em>, and none of this stuff has any place in that fantasy. You can deam of lining your political enemies up against a wall and shooting them, and if they shoot you instead, that’s not so bad either. Actual civil war has less romance.</p><p>Really, talking about armaments at all misses the point; it’s just part of the shit-talking that accompanies the civil-war fantasy. Right-wing fantasists used to point out that their side has all the firearms, and they also know how to grow food out the ground, while liberals are all weak, squeamish men with noodle arms who recoil in horror at both guns and dirt, and who think food is spontaneously generated at the supermarket. Any war would last five minutes. You don’t hear that sort of bluster so much any more, not now that liberals have started earnestly identifying with the institutions of American imperialism. Weak noodle arms are all you need to direct a drone strike from a secure bunker on the other side of the country. Your AR-15 isn’t much good against an F-16. So there’s a new fantasy. Jet fighters didn’t stop the Taliban humiliating the woke empire, and aren’t the Taliban basically just a group of pissed-off social conservatives with a few small arms and homemade bombs? Don’t the scrappy Houthis shrug off airstrikes like they’re nothing? </p><p>It doesn't matter, in this <em>Dune</em>-flavoured version of things, that the Taliban aren't really sons of the soil, but a cadre of highly educated jurists and clerics who want to wipe out much of traditional Pashtun culture, while most of the Houthi forces are simply the ordinary armed forces of Yemen. But consider that America, a country whose most committed ideologues spend all day looking at the internet, might not have the same stamina for counterinsurgency warfare as Yemen or Afghanistan. People in those countries were willing to suffer endlessly for victory; Americans keep going into big wet hysterics because their favourite TV shows cast too many black people, or not enough. </p><p>Let’s imagine, though. Even if an American insurgency held out, it would be very bad for people who support the rebels but are too asthmatic or autistic or otherwise unfit to fight—that is, most of the people currently fantasising about a civil war. As the sea in which the revolutionaries swim, the repressive state’s first priority will be to drain you, probably into some kind of torture camp. If you think you're being persecuted and cancelled for your opinions now, you've seen nothing yet. During the war in the Vendée, anyone accused of insufficient zeal for the cause of liberty was drowned in the Loire. They called it the National Bathtub. Being particularly harmless, elderly priests and nuns were a popular target. And if you’re not briefly squished by your enemies, you’ll then have to deal with your own side. In most civil wars the armed factions end up as roving bands of plunderers—and since their enemies are more likely to put up a fight, they usually plunder their <em>own supporters</em> most of all. In the English Civil War, plenty of fervent bourgeois Puritans ended up fleeing London just to protect some of their property from seizure; meanwhile equally fervent royalists in the countryside welcomed the Parliamentary troops that finally put an end to the ransackings from His Majesty’s garrisons. You’ve been endlessly grousing over the first and second amendments; when it all goes to shit the one you’ll really miss is the third. Here they are: your valiant defenders have arrived to take over your six-bedroom wood-framed McMansion, rape your wife, shit in your kitchen, burn all your stuff for warmth, and fire a wire-guided anti-tank missile out of your great room window, at which point a suicide drone will kill them all by flying into your roof. This is what you wanted, remember. You wanted your team and your enemies to fight.</p><p>It might not be as bad as that. You might be lucky enough to experience the civil war as a bureaucratic chore. There are four different self-proclaimed governments now, all demanding you pay them taxes. Like all truly evil forces, H&amp;R Block and its lobbyists have found a way to align with every side at once, so the compulsory mutual aid payments for the Syndicate of People’s Autonomous Zones are every bit as tedious as the tithes demanded by the Christians Upholding Nation and Tradition. The difference is that they won't just be demanding money; they'll also take you into a basement and poke holes in you with power tools if you pay taxes to any of the <em>wrong</em> governments. You can keep paying off whichever flimsily ideological meth gang runs your suburb for a while, but what if the frontline gets too hot and they retreat? Suddenly you’re not an upstanding citizen any more, but a collaborator. Good luck. </p><div><hr></div><p>But this is the other problem: who would actually form the opposing sides in this war? If it isn’t SPAZ and CUNT, who is it? In the Garland film, the US Government is opposed by the ‘Western Forces of Texas and California’ and the ‘Florida Alliance.’ Utah has joined the insurrection but Arizona has not. Minnesota is in open rebellion against the United States while Wisconsin is loyal. When I was eight, I wrote a science fiction story about a third world war in the very futuristic year of 2014, in which an alliance of Russia, Italy, Canada, and Japan faced off against Britain, China, Greece, and Spain. This is somehow less plausible than that. Garland’s point is that once a war gets going, the precise makeup of forces doesn’t matter; violence has its own logic. When our journalists encounter a sniper team pinned down in a field, the soldiers refuse to even say which side they’re on, just that someone’s trying to kill them and they want to kill him first. And Garland’s actually completely right here, just not in the way he thinks. A lot of viewers are furious, though. As Max Read points out, the half-arsed sketched-in backstory has robbed them of the chance to make pedantic little YouTube lore videos about it. The film isn’t ‘deep and sophisticated enough to support a thriving media economy of explication, analysis, and fan theory.’ And what else is cinema for?</p><p>Personally, I liked the Western Forces gimmick. It’s stupid, but it reveals something: that every other version is stupid too.</p><p>What would be more realistic? Red states versus blue states? But there are no red or blue states, just states with more or less heavily suburbanised metro areas. Politics is downstream of zoning. Everywhere is a mess of blue cities and red suburbs, dotted like mildew, and it’s hard to carry out a war when 45% of your population is on the other side. So maybe it’ll be the parties themselves, Republicans versus Democrats. There is actually a precedent here; political parties in a faltering democracy have decided to stop competing in elections and take up arms instead. In Colombia’s <em>La Violencia</em>, the Liberals and Conservatives fought to a stalemate from 1948 to 1958. If you want, you can try to imagine Nancy Pelosi camped out in the mountains with her peasant militia, planning a raid on Colorado Springs. Mitch McConnell lurking in the tupelo swamps with the last remnants of his Republican Guard, swapping steak and champagne for tinned rations, vowing to die with a gun in his hand… Feels unlikely, doesn’t it? In Colombia, one party represented tenant farmers and farmworkers, the other represented their landlords. The civil war was the political expression of a social contradiction. What actual contradiction do Republicans and Democrats represent? Spectrums of opinion about gender identity that overlap significantly but not entirely? 54% versus 45% of people making over $100,000 a year? Wokeness? What?</p><p>The most accidentally insightful account I’ve seen came from an article earnestly advocating for a national divorce. According to the author, it’s impossible for the ‘America of Whole Foods’ and the ‘America of Cracker Barrel’ to exist together in a single polity. But these aren’t sides in a civil war. They aren’t even political factions. You could call them cultural blocs or tribes if you want, but that would miss the point. These are <em>market segments</em>. </p><p>The sphere of production divides people into classes. Relations between classes are inevitably antagonistic, because they’re competing for their share of the value of the commodity. The sphere of <em>circulation</em> divides people into market segments. Unlike classes, these groups don’t compete over anything. By definition, they’re consuming different stuff! Whole Foods is not in an antagonistic relationship with Cracker Barrel; in fact, they’re <em>complementary</em>. Over a quarter of Cracker Barrel is owned by two investment funds, Blackrock and Vanguard. The same two funds also own over a tenth of Amazon, which owns Whole Foods. Differentiating products for a variety of consumer groups means you can squeeze more profit out of them; it’s always useful to have a market for offcuts. These segments might vaguely map on to economic classes, but it’s always extremely hazy and inexact. There are teamsters who shop at Whole Foods. There are bankers who can’t get enough loaded hashbrown casserole. Still, whenever people try to talk about class, they end up talking about burgers and salads and all the other sorts of products people <em>buy</em>, as if that’s even remotely the same thing.</p><p>Everyone agrees that America is more politically polarised than ever before. It isn’t. There’s no properly <em>political</em> polarisation at all, just differentiation by lifestyle brands. The parties do sometimes stand for different sectors of capital, but there's not really any massive antagonism there either. Team diversity and inclusion represents finance, tech, aerospace, and real estate. Team rampant patriarchal fascistic power represents resource extraction, manufacturing, aerospace, and construction. The capitalists who buy and sell land and the capitalists who put up buildings might have slightly different policy preferences, but they’re not trying to violently overthrow each other. This means no allegiance has to be stable, and there’s a good deal of policy drift between the two parties. At first, liberals hated Trump’s China tariffs, which protected some forms of local manufacturing and raw materials processing while potentially disrupting finance, but in the end Biden chose to leave them in place.</p><p>Still, a lot of people do seem to think that it’s somehow <em>not allowed</em> to belong to the other market segment. See that review in <em>WIRED</em>: right and left, unmoored from any reference to actual political economy, end up standing for <em>cruelty</em> and <em>kindness</em>. Why should the kind allow anyone to be cruel? (Meanwhile, conservatives are currently freaking out over the fact that the new head of NPR is—gasp—a standard-issue lib.) You can see this structure wherever the market is split into basically arbitrary groups; try asking one of the BTS Army if it should be legal to stan EXO instead. But politics is where it really all comes out. Ordinarily, you hardly ever encounter anyone from the other moiety—the more rationalised the economy becomes, the more total the division into hermetic consumer niches—but because you live in a representative democracy, you will end up being made aware of their <em>politicians</em>. It’s horrible. Of course it’s horrible: these scumbags are pandering to people who don’t even go to the same shops as you. You’re desperate to get rid of them, but somehow even winning elections doesn’t make them go away forever. So you conclude that the political system has failed: it's not up to the job of pointlessly wiping out half the economy. War, on the other hand—war might do the trick. Garland was right: once you’re in the civil-war fantasy, it really doesn’t matter what the warring sides stand for. It’s just death and violence. That’s all you actually want.</p><p>It wasn’t always politics. You might remember that about a decade and a half ago, the reigning media fantasy was the <em>zombie apocalypse</em>. A huge industry fed you constant images of the zombie apocalypse, alongside other forms of civilisation-ending disaster. Cities collapsing into volcanic calderas or blown away like cobwebs by weapons from outer space. But everyone loved the zombies most of all. Why? What is a zombie? Well, he looks exactly like your neighbour, and stumbles around in your neighbour’s house, but it’s no longer morally or legally impermissible to blow his head off with a shotgun. Zombie apocalypse means all rules are suspended and pure hostility reigns. For a while, it was considered normal to announce to vague acquaintances that you had a <em>plan for the zombie apocalypse</em>—in other words, that you were actively fantasising about murdering everyone you knew. But of course you were. You live in the land of the free, and the world was made for your pleasure. </p>

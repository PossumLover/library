It’s gone. Whatever still exists is just a remnant, barely hanging on in its own country, and in a few decades it’ll probably be snuffed out for good. The English way of existing in the world is steadily being eroded by foreign customs. Already, the country I grew up in is unrecognisable, full of strange and angry people spouting misshapen foreign ideas. Foreign ideas about the need for a <em>shared</em> <em>community</em>. About how society isn’t just a collection of individuals, but a group with a <em>common purpose</em>, growing out of the traditional structures of kith and kin. About a people deeply rooted in a particular place, and about the placeless migrants like locusts on the wind, tearing it all apart. This stuff isn’t just on the fringes any more: this month, even the Prime Minister started talking about how uncontrolled immigration means ‘we risk becoming an island of strangers, not a nation that walks forward together.’ What hope is there for England when even its leaders are spouting this dreck?</p><p>You have never been deeply rooted in any particular place, and you have always been an island of strangers. The current level of migration might not be to everyone’s benefit, or even really <em>anyone’s</em> benefit (more on that later), but it can’t destroy what doesn’t exist. There <em>used</em> to be a people who were deeply rooted in this place, a millennium and a half ago, but not any more. They went with the giants. </p><p>When the first refugees came here after the sack of Troy, they found the place wild and empty, but not silent: at night, in the hills and the forests, they trembled at the inarticulate groans of giants. The people built cities, and the giants came howling out of the hills to smash down the walls. Geoffey of Monmouth says the last of the giants were killed by Brutus and Corineus in Cernyw, but later at least one giant, Brân Fendigaidd son of Llŷr, became king of the Britons. They must have made some kind of peace; after that it was the blood of the giants that ruled. Brân was so huge that no house could contain him. After his sister Branwen was mistreated by Matholwch king of Ireland, Brân Fendigaidd sent an army from all the one hundred and fifty-four districts of Britain to sail over and rescue her, but because he was too big to fit in a ship he had to wade across the Irish Sea. When the swineherds of Ireland saw him in the distance, they mistook him for a mountain rising out of the water, and his two furious eyes for two gleaming lakes. By the end Brân had laid waste to so much of Ireland that the only survivors were five pregnant women hiding in a cave, but in the fighting his foot was pierced by a poisoned spear. He told his followers to cut off his head and bury it at the Gwynfryn in Caer Lud, facing south. As long as his head was in that spot, no oppression would ever come from across the sea to the Island of Britain. The noble triads in the Red Book of Hergest record that the burying of Brân’s head was the first of the Three Fortunate Concealments; the third of the Three Unfortunate Unconcealments was when Arthur decided to dig it up again. It hurt his pride to imagine that the land would need any protection other than himself, so he disinterred the head, and then he defended these shores until he died. And then, oozing against the beaches of this island like an algae bloom, the Saxons came. </p><p>It might not be nice to point this out, it might not be politically correct, but the Saxons really don’t belong here. Even after all this time, fifteen hundred years of this great bunch of lads tactically chundering all over Arthur’s kingdom, they’re still uncomfortable in the land. Like their thing with the weather. The Saxons will not stop complaining about the weather. The springs are too grey. The summers are too mild. It’s literally all they talk about, how endlessly disappointed they are by this country’s weather, and how desperate they are to briefly fly off somewhere else. Well, not to be rude, but if you hate it so much, then what the fuck are you doing here? If you wanted a long, hot, dry summer, and a fairytale winter where it always snows on Christmas, you should have stayed in the marshes of the Elbe where you came from. Why would you come to an island with such a witchy, mystic climate, silver curtains of rain, fog, weather that changes unpredictably several times a day—and then jump on the first RyanAir to Marbella? Why didn’t you join up with the Visigoths instead? You had a choice.</p><p>But this island was always just a brief staging-post for the Saxons: a few hundred years here to gather supplies, work on new types of rigging, and then off again to spread their sickness across the world. This is why the salmon-hunting grounds of the Tlingit and Salish, where animal ancestors grinned from wooden poles in the mist, are now part of something called British Columbia. Why you can fly to Te Ika-a-Maui, an island lost in endless ocean, on a wild and distant hemisphere, where all the old stories are about canoes, taro, salt-spray, gods woven from coconut fibre, and find it full of awkward people with wonky smiles dunking biscuits in milky tea. </p><p>Are they comfortable there? Of course not. The Saxons aren’t comfortable anywhere. There’s never been a people that squirms so awkwardly inside their own skin. Talking about sex famously throws them into crisis, but so does talking about <em>anything</em>. They sit on trains, silent. On the bus, silent. They spend first dates mutually dabbing at their phones. In the rest of Europe people might go to a restaurant together on their lunch breaks, but not the Saxon, who sits silently by himself on a park bench, eating a packaged sandwich from M&amp;S. The only time they can bear to talk to each other is when they’re at the pub, coked up and drunk. This is why so many of them spend their entire lives on the piss, and why they all end up looking that way.</p><p>It’s easy—and fun—to throw lazy cultural stereotypes around, but this one comes with data. Most of it was first gathered by Peter Laslett and the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure, who found that already by the medieval period, the English were not living like their neighbours in continental Europe. Other Europeans were mostly sedentary. They lived in strong clan or village-based kinship structures that held land in common. People married early, had children early, raised those children in gregarious and multigenerational households. They spent their lives enmeshed in the networks of social bonds that are, according to every society in human history, what make us truly human. Aristotle said that we are a <em>zoon politikon</em>, and only beasts or gods could live alone, but Aristotle never saw the English. </p><p>From the moment they set foot in this country they’ve been weird, untethered and autistic. In medieval Spain or Italy, girls were usually married in their mid-teens, and men around 20; the average English woman was 24 years old at first marriage, and the average man was 27. For most young people in England, the period before marriage wasn’t spent with the kinship group, but in service: wage-labour. Poll tax records from 1377 show that over 13% of rural households in England included unrelated servants; in contemporary France the number was closer to 2%, almost all of them aristocratic estates. England had a large supply of mobile, disposable labour-power. Most people moved short distances, but it was perfectly ordinary to travel a long way in search of employment. In 1327, 4.1% of York’s population had come from more than 40 miles away, some from up to 100. When they did marry, the English almost always set up a separate household away from both sets of parents. Some 65% of English households in 1377 were nuclear families, managing their own plots of land, cut off from any larger kinship group. Even then they wouldn’t necessarily stay put; fourteenth-century manorial rolls show that over the course of a decade, roughly a third of all tenant farmers—that is, people supposedly bonded to the land—would move residence. Another village, another set of neighbours to never talk to. By the fifteenth century foreign observers were starting to notice that the English do not behave like normal, friendly people. Andrea Trevisano, ambassador from Venice, reported that ‘the English are great lovers of themselves and of everything belonging to them; they think that there are no other men than themselves.’ But really, these rootless friendless creatures are hardly men at all. In 1472, his Milanese opposite number wrote that ‘they are evil islanders born with tails.’</p><p>You call it neoliberal atomisation. In fact, it’s the ancient time-honoured folkways of the English.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>They’re not the only primitive people to have engaged in some form of cultural self-mutilation. People do a lot of odd stuff; any practice you can think of has been carried out by someone, somewhere. The foreskin is the most familiar sacrifice, although plenty of societies have demanded that their bureaucratic class give up their balls instead. There have been tribes of the blind, where they pluck out every newborn baby’s eyes, or monopod clans that saw below the knee on initiation. In Mesoamerica, tongue mutilation was a common devotional practice. Pierce the tongue with a maguey thorn or stingray spine, and then pass a barbed cord through the wound to produce a good thick dribble of blood. Ordinary people had to do this a few times a year, on festivals; for priests it was a daily observance. There would have been priests who were no longer capable of speaking, because they’d repurposed the tongue into a blood-faucet for Itzamná and Kinich Ahau. They might be gross, but these mutilations are not always senseless. The imperial eunuchs of Egypt and China were castrated to prevent court functionaries from generating their own dynasties, and while Chinese history is not exactly calm it might have been even worse without the practice. It’s possible that the speechless priests of Mesoamerica served the same function, especially when you consider that the Nahuatl word for ruler, <em>tlatoani</em>, literally means <em>the one who speaks</em>. </p><p>There’s no indication that the English had any similar idea of what they were doing; they were simply broken. Instead of legs, tongues, or foreskins, they had accidentally amputated the social. Not something you want to lose: we can be happy blind or mute or one-legged or dickless, as long as we’re still able to love and live with one another; without that there’s just the void. What’s strange is that this band of graceless Germans were broken in the one precise configuration that allowed them to develop capitalism, start producing an enormous surplus of consumer goods, break through the Malthusian limits that had constrained human life since the Pleistocene, and take over the world. </p><p>Under conditions of fully human sociability, any surplus inevitably gets diffused away through the web of social bonds. Everyone feasts together all summer, bucolic cider-swigging peasant geniality, and then in winter they all starve to death. The only way to actually start the process of accumulation is to live far away from your extended family. Once you divert all the resources that once went into reproducing social life into reproducing <em>capital</em>, amazing things happen. Maybe it’s wrong to say that the English developed capitalism, when capitalism is so obviously just Englishness in the form of a fissile chain reaction. Social bonds are like nuclear bonds: when you tear them apart, it releases an enormous amount of energy. This is what Marx called primitive accumulation. The upshot is that, in the few short centuries since the chain reaction started, the entire planet has had to assimilate to the social norms of a few uncomfortable geeks on an island off the coast of Europe. Obviously the process has not been uniform, but the results are pretty clear. Those societies that still try to maintain the old values of family, community, and hospitality will be poor, corrupt, violent, and dysfunctional. Italy is friendlier and more dysfunctional than Japan; Lebanon is friendlier and more dysfunctional than Italy; Afghanistan has the most hospitable people in the world and look where that got them. These societies will also be in decay: slowly pulled apart by the entropic force of Englishness, the universal solvent of nations and peoples, which will eat away at your ancient culture until all that’s left is one great shapeless swarm of buzzing monads pursuing their own narrow gnatlike interests. </p><p>Given all this, it should be very difficult for the English to have any complaints about mass immigration.</p><p>But clearly, something has gone wrong. Englishness really does seem to be dying. If it were <em>healthy</em>, the presence of a few million immigrants would not cause any kind of moral crisis at all. Not so long ago, Englishness could swallow up the iron rule of kings and priests, blow through ancient empires like clouds of dust, attack and dethrone God. Now, apparently, it can’t quite metabolise Luton. No one believes in it any more. The solvent no longer solves. Which is why all politics in Britain is melting into various forms of tweedy bullshit about identity, belonging, togetherness, community, and the merry hobbits of the Shire.</p><p>The usual complaint is that migrants aren’t properly integrating, but that’s not really it. What people actually object to is a failure to <em>disintegrate</em>. You can see it if you so much as glance at Twitter, which will now immediately serve you hundreds of posts showing a street scene in a Muslim area, along with a hysterical caption: London has fallen, Leicester has fallen, the little scrap of grass inside the roundabout in Barton-under-Needwood has fallen. What these videos actually show is the sentimental reactionary’s dream, just realised by the wrong people. A strong, homogenous, close-knit community anchored in thriving religious institutions. In the rest of Britain, the streets are full of people shuffling in silence with headphones on, but here it’s a fully social space. People drag chairs and tables out into the street for iftar, just like in 1953. Most British high streets are faceless and identical, Tesco and Sainsbury’s and Coral and Paddy Power and Costa and Pret, and sometimes you can walk them from end to end without seeing a single thing you haven’t seen before—but not here. Wherever white British make up less than a quarter of the population, the tide of chainstore slop recedes. Migrant populations prefer local, independent businesses, where you know the person behind the till, where commercial relations are an <em>extension</em> of human relations and not the thing that’s come to replace them. People know their neighbours. They look after each other’s kids after school.</p><p>In reality, it’s obviously not quite as bucolic as that. Every thick community is basically stultifying; I’m very glad not to live in one. Like many arrivals, my own immigrant ancestors more or less disintegrated in the suburbs, instead of preserving the shtetl in Stamford Hill. This suits me fine. In a strong community you do not get to be by yourself; you go through life being constantly poked and peered at by a legion of unrelated aunties and uncles. Conformism prevails. Discovering that you’re gay or an atheist can mean exile into the English abyss. And gregarious societies can’t afford to take sex as lightly as the Saxons do. Men and women are not just free-floating monads maximising their own utility, and the sexual relation isn’t really between the two people actually fucking each other; it’s how the whole kinship structure reproduces itself. One solution is the organised seclusion or suppression of women. From within this system, the shapeless and sexually liberalised society that surrounds it looks a lot like universal prostitution. When the two codes rub up against one another, horrible things can happen.</p><p>Last summer, the UK saw some of the worst race riots in living memory. Pogroms, attacks on shops and homes owned by Muslims, or sometimes on random minorities on the street. In Rotherham they tried to set fire to a hotel housing asylum seekers. In Middlesborough they enforced an impromptu racial checkpoint. ‘Are you white? Are you English?’ Mostly, though, the riots tended to involve a small clump of gacked-up losers looting sausage rolls from Gregg’s. The response was not always particularly inspiring either. In Birmingham a large group of young Muslim men decided to defend their community by mobbing a pub called the Clumsy Swan. In one video, you can hear one of them explain his reasoning. ‘We’re coming over to the pub,’ he says. ‘We’re showing dominance, asserting dominance over everybody, you know what I mean?’ They then proceed to pounce on a man caught having a cig outside. Making takbir as they batter him. O brave warriors, the Exalted One will surely make a reward for you in Jannah for these mighty deeds! After a week of this, a list started circulating online, detailing sites across the country that far-right thugs were supposedly about to hit. I went to the emergency rally outside an immigration centre in Walthamstow, but more out of a vague sense of solidarity than because I thought it actually needed protecting. As expected, the far-right thugs didn’t show. Violence did not break out. Instead, an enormous crowd of mingled Muslims and middle-class art students and old Caribbean ladies and various other London types packed the street, chanting together for an hour or two at no one in particular. Eventually I wandered off to do a bit of local tourism; the most fascist thing I saw that day was Philip Hepworth’s Waltham Forest Town Hall. Afterwards, like everyone else, I quietly went home.</p><p>London is more diverse than any Northern shithole, but there was no communal violence in London. Why not? Stupid question. Because it’s <em>London</em>, and London is where all the money is. London has high-paying jobs and economic growth, while the rest of the country slowly converges with Moldova. London is home to a disproportionate chunk of the black and Asian bourgeoisie, who are obviously as impeccably disintegrated as anyone else in their class. In London it’s still possible to pretend that England’s deal with the devil, social atomisation for economic prosperity, is still being honoured. (The trajectory might matter more than the straightforward level of wealth: in parts of the world that are still experiencing rapid development, young people are often <em>more</em> liberal, secular, and atomised than their cousins who grew up in the heart of the decadent West.) The capital can still chew up all social forms, even if it sometimes needs to put its dentures in first. But even here things are not heading in a good direction.</p><p>The typical pragmatic argument against immigration is that migrants drive down wages. They do this by forcing workers in the host country to compete for scarce jobs with an essentially limitless pool of cheap labour. But in fact, as liberal economists love to point out, this is something called a ‘lump of labour’ fallacy, and it’s not true. There’s no empirical evidence that high migration has any major effect on wages. This is because migrants don’t just fill jobs, they are also human beings who require goods and services. The increased demand they represent leads to more jobs somewhere else in the economy; in the end it all more or less balances out. This is where the liberals exit the conversation. It’s left to a few scattered Marxists like Michael Piore to point out that the inverse is still true. Immigration doesn’t cause low wages, but <em>low wages do cause immigration</em>. </p><p>Mass immigration is what happens when demand is concentrated in the secondary labour market, in low-paid jobs that can be performed by any interchangeable quantity of meat. This is what’s been happening in Britain. This country’s main approach since the 2008 financial crisis has been to depress wages in order to make the UK a more attractive prospect for foreign investment. But since the glut of casualised low-wage work hasn’t been particularly attractive to British workers, a full 90% of the 4.6 million net jobs added since 2004 have been filled by people born abroad. If you’ve spent any amount of time here, you’ll know what this looks like. Millions of people have arrived here to carry out undignified service-sector drudge-work that <em>would not exist</em> if the cost of labour were higher. They have crossed oceans and continents to stand in the self-checkout area, chanting card payment, next card payment please, card payment, next card payment please, for eight thankless hours a day. They have come from every corner of the world to deliver lukewarm hamburgers to office workers who can’t be bothered to cook. I’ve mentioned this before, but Uber drivers often enter a trancelike state during long shifts: they’ll spend twelve hours driving around Britain, picking people up and dropping them off; the body relays instructions from the phone screen to the steering wheel, while the mind simply dissipates. When black cab drivers navigate London they have to draw on enormous conscious reserves of memory; for the predominately immigrant app drivers, waking life in this country is a kind of somnambulism. The loneliness of a dream. This is not quite the same as the Windrush generation rebuilding Britain after the war. </p><p>There’s a weird tendency on the left to uphold immigration as a good in and of itself. This might be an understandable response to the outright racism that will occasionally bubble up on the other side, but people don’t always keep their story straight. Sometimes a few over-eager culture warriors will try to complicate things by imagining immigration as a kind of penance for the sins of empire, or a weapon against English national chauvinism. But immigration is not necessarily good, and it’s definitely not in any kind of real opposition to Englishness. Nothing could be more English than a constant circuit of untethered monads. In a genuinely free and liberated world, migration would be a much more minor phenomenon. The countries of the south would not be full of people desperate to leave everything they know for a council flat in Chingford; the countries of the north would not need to consume a constant stream of ripe human bodies. We would still move around, because the human being has always been restless, but it would look like something very different, a kind of slow tourism, or a mass embassy. In its current form, meanwhile, migration is mostly just an index of the cheapness of life, in the host country and beyond.</p><p>Nativist ideologues are not <em>wrong</em> that this country is in trouble, and they’re not wrong that migration is somehow involved. It’s just that (whether for reasons of bigotry or not) they’ve mixed up cause and effect. England is over; the chain reaction has finally burned through its fuel. Their own ideology is just another symptom of decline. We’re now in the long slow recoil back into the dumb parochialism of the earth. If I were in the business of suggesting solutions I’d say that you could cut net migration rates, integrate a multicultural population, halt the growth of the far right and prevent national decline, all with a decent-sized programme of state investment in productive industry. But it’s probably too late for that. The end of this country was prophesied a very long time ago. In his ninth-century <em>Historia Brittonum</em>, Nennius tells the story of Vortigern, the weak and cruel King of the Britons. Among his many sins, Vortigern married his daughter, abandoned his son, followed pagan sorcerers instead of Christian saints, and invited the heathen Saxons from across the sea to this island, which is how we all got in this mess. When his Saxon allies turned on him and started ravaging the land, Vortigern fled to the mountains of Gwynedd to build a fortress against the invaders, but the fortress kept crumbling all by itself. His wizards told him to kill a child and consecrate the ground with his blood, but the child told him to dig. Underneath the site of his castle, Vortigern found a pool, and in the pool were a red and a white dragon, shaking the earth with their writhing. ‘The serpents began to struggle with each other; and the white one, raising himself up, threw down the other, and sometimes drove him to the edge; and this was repeated thrice. At length the red one, apparently the weaker of the two, recovering his strength, expelled the white one and the latter disappeared.’ The boy interpreted the vision. The red dragon represents the Britons, and the white dragon represents the Saxons. The Saxons had driven the Britons to the edge of their kingdom, but in time ‘our people shall rise and drive away the Saxon race from beyond the sea, whence they originally came.’ Later the story grew. The child became Myrddin Wyllt, who became the wizard Merlin; his vision of the dragons became the Prophetiae Merlini. For a thousand years the Britons repeated the prophecy and lived in hope. One day they will be gone. One day the Saxons and everything they represent will simply disappear.</p>

There’s an entire stadium for the occasion. For about half an hour, two sets of border guards in magnificently silly uniforms march and stomp about in front of each other in a kind of Punjabi hakka. I’d expected all the theatrical stomping and marching and high-kicking; what I didn’t know is that it starts with a moaning competition. To rapturous applause, the becrested border guards stand in a line and moan. Oooooaaaaaaah, they say. They keep holding their single note until it sounds like a plane passing very slowly overhead, or an air raid siren. Then their opposite numbers do the same thing. Our country can raise its knees higher than yours. Our country can hold its breath longer than yours. Ooooaaaaaah. After several rounds of this, the gates are briefly opened, and the guards attempt to lower their respective flags at exactly the same time. This is followed by a terse handshake and some more stomping, and then everyone goes home. It’s hugely popular. It happens every single day. </p><p>Before you can get to the actual ceremony, though, there are several hours of intensely tacky nationalist pomp. On the Indian side, two huge outdoor screens played constant patriotic montages of the Taj Mahal, the Himalayas, and tigers in the jungle, randomly interspersed with shots of beefy moustachioed soldiers posing in front of multiple-launch rocket systems and armoured personnel carriers. Big thudding portentous drums. Then various members of the public ran around in front of the border waving huge Indian flags. This part was choreographed by an extremely fey man in military fatigues, who rans around after them, extravagantly swooping his arms at various sectors of the audience to make them cheer. Bharat mata ki! he bellowed. Jai! everyone chants. Louder! he bellowed. I can’t hear you! Bharat mata ki! Even more deafening: Jai! The hype man ran a few ecstatic laps of the stadium, grinning with an Indian flag in each hand. He looked exactly like a more militarised Freddie Mercury. I wondered how he got the gig. Did they just select the most exuberant, theatrical soldier from among their ranks? Or did a general of the Border Security Force appear at some student nightclub or children’s birthday party with a suitcase full of cash? You have a very particular skillset; your country needs you, we must not lose the hype war with Pakistan… Anyway, once he’d done a few more call-and-response routines, the stage was cleared and hundreds of women in colourful saris descended from the stands to dance. Blaring, patriotic Bollywood music. There was one called <em>Yeh Desh Hai Veer Jawanon Ka</em> (sample lyrics: ‘This is the country of brave soldiers, this country is the jewel of the world’), but the song that’s been stuck in my head ever since is called <em>Hindustani</em>, and it nicely combines a very catchy tune with some very bitter nationalism. ‘Listen carefully, people of the world, don’t cast the evil eye on us; no matter how hard you try, India will always be ahead of everyone.’ My girlfriend went down to dance and had a great time. There was no men’s dance. The whole exercise was to prove a point: in India, everyone is free to have fun. In Pakistan, women don’t dance. In the West, meanwhile, men and women can dance <em>together</em>, but I didn’t press the point. Through the bars, I could just see the equivalent display on the Pakistani side. A single whirling dervish, dressed all in austere white. When there were gaps in the frantic Hindi pop I could hear their music too, which consisted of unaccompanied Arabic wailing. They knew they couldn’t compete on entertainment value, so they were clearly trying to project a kind of quiet dignity. Some hoardings extended right up to the border, where they seemed to be building more stands. These were decorated with the Pakistani flag and the slogan ‘77 YEARS OF RESILIENCE,’ which is exactly the kind of motto you go with when your national project is going really, really well.</p><p>Wagah is probably where India-Pakistan relations are at their friendliest. During Eid and Diwali, the border guards even exchange sweets. The whole thing is ritualised here, made spectacular and stupid, and it’s all in good fun. Elsewhere, not so much. These people really do not like each other. Before I arrived here, Instagram’s algorithm (which knows everything and is not afraid to be creepy about it) started showing me lots of videos of miserable squalor in south Asia, and in the comments I got to see the sharp intellectual back-and-forth of the Indo-Pakistani rivalry happening in front of my eyes. The most refined version consists of Indians saying that this particular slum could only be in Pakistan, and Pakistanis insisting it’s in India. But mostly people don’t bother with words at all, and just post the other country’s flag emoji next to the emoji of a smiling turd with eyes. At a conservative estimate, two thirds of the populations of both India and Pakistan spend every free moment insulting each other online. Sometimes this escalates: there have been four full-scale wars. Frequent border skirmishes. Terrorist atrocities on each other’s soil. But they’re not always wrong about each other, the shit-posters on Instagram. They might have flags and armies, but neither India nor Pakistan is in any meaningful sense a <em>real country</em>. What they are is the residue left by two political parties. These two parties were in coalition from 1916, and plenty of senior officials were members of both groups at the same time. But eventually relations frayed, and the two parties split again, and started gobbling up tracts of land, and now the inheritors of those two political parties are pointing nuclear weapons at each other, threatening to wipe out nearly one quarter of the world’s population. For the sake of the future of humanity, both India and Pakistan must be abolished.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde22dca5-4413-4093-ad8f-1ee25ae07783_2048x1514.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde22dca5-4413-4093-ad8f-1ee25ae07783_2048x1514.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde22dca5-4413-4093-ad8f-1ee25ae07783_2048x1514.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde22dca5-4413-4093-ad8f-1ee25ae07783_2048x1514.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde22dca5-4413-4093-ad8f-1ee25ae07783_2048x1514.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde22dca5-4413-4093-ad8f-1ee25ae07783_2048x1514.jpeg" width="1456" height="1076" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/de22dca5-4413-4093-ad8f-1ee25ae07783_2048x1514.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1076,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:536753,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde22dca5-4413-4093-ad8f-1ee25ae07783_2048x1514.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde22dca5-4413-4093-ad8f-1ee25ae07783_2048x1514.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde22dca5-4413-4093-ad8f-1ee25ae07783_2048x1514.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde22dca5-4413-4093-ad8f-1ee25ae07783_2048x1514.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>My girlfriend, who as you’ll remember once taught the history of Indian independence and partition, came away from the experience with a strange fondness for Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of the All-India Muslim League, and revered in Pakistan as the Baba-e-Qaum or Father of the Nation. This despite the fact that Jinnah might have fucked up more utterly, and with more disastrous results, than any other individual human being in history. But I get it. Jinnah was handsome, dapper, fine-featured, with a good pair of piercing hawklike eyes. He looked like he could have been played by Christopher Lee in a film, and he was. He had a fundamental <em>dignity</em> the other great independence leaders lacked. Gandhi, the London-trained lawyer from a political dynasty who went about dressed like a sadhu and thought the best path for Indian self-rule was for everyone to stop having sex. Nehru, pretentious and blubbering over the mystic unity of the homeland. Next to them, Jinnah is a much more serious figure. He had a goal—a better deal for India’s Muslims—and he was willing to do the political work necessary to achieve it. He was secular and Westernised, pork-eating, whisky-drinking, out-marrying, and made no apology for any of it. He wasn’t interested in mythologising himself. In a subcontinent of mystics and wafflers, Jinnah was very refreshingly down to earth. Gandhi once declared: ‘I am a Hindu, a Muslim, a Christian, a Parsi, a Jew.’ Jinnah replied: ‘Only a Hindu could say that.’ </p><p>Jinnah’s motivations make a lot of sense. Before the Muslim League, the Indian independence movement was—of course—a movement to liberate the whole of India from foreign oppression in a spirit of Hindu-Muslim unity, but that unity had a weirdly Hindu character. Its leaders had a habit of treating India and Hinduism like they were the same thing, and implicitly dismissing Islam, the region of more than a fifth of the Indian population, as just another foreign imposition. Some of this was symbolic. The nationalist anthem, <em>Vande Mataram</em>, directly identifies Mother India with the goddess Durga, who doesn’t appear anywhere in the Qur’an. Some of it was more urgent. <em>Vande Mataram</em> was drawn from Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s 1882 novel <em>Anandamath</em>, the book that essentially spawned the entire nationalist movement. Its heroes don’t just rise up against the hated British, but also have a habit of saying things like ‘We have often thought to break up this bird’s nest of Moslem rule—to burn this pig-sty to ashes and make Mother Earth free from evil again.’ Near the end, the victorious rebels celebrate the defeat of the British usurpers by enacting a pogrom against Muslims. ‘The villagers would chase any Mussulman that they would meet—some would combine and go to the Mussulman quarters to set fire to their houses and pillage them. Many Moslems shaved off their beards, smeared their bodies with earth and sung Harinam.’ Meanwhile the event that most catalysed the demand for Indian self-government was Britain’s 1905 attempt to carve out a new Muslim-majority presidency in east Bengal. Hindus were up in arms about it. They insisted on remaining in the majority. You can understand why someone like Jinnah might wonder why this was, or what exactly would be in store for India’s Muslims in a self-governing India where the majority ruled.</p><p>The official story is that he found a solution to the problem: the Pakistan idea. After years wasted trying to extract a better deal from the Hindu chauvinists in the Congress Party, he finally understood that India’s Muslims constituted a separate people, and the only way they could live safe from persecution was in a separate state. It took a lot of pushing, but in the end Jinnah finally convinced the British and the Congress to accept the inevitable, and the glorious new nation of Pakistan was born. But there are a few inconvenient details for the official story. Like the fact that as Partition neared, Jinnah kept emerging from meetings ashen-faced and trembling. Look at the photo above, which shows him, Nehru, and Mountbatten in June 1947, one month before Partition. The other guy in the picture is Hastings Ismay, Mountbatten’s advisor, who looks strangely cheerful. But Mountbatten is clearly utterly sick of the whole thing, Nehru’s face is grim, and Jinnah looks <em>haunted</em>, like he’s just had to dismember a child with his bare hands. There’s a growing view among historians that perhaps Muhammad Ali Jinna did not actually want to become the Baba-e-Qaum at all.</p><p>This view makes a lot of sense to me, so much that from now on I’m just going to assume it’s true. (If it helps, personal accounts by people close to him do seem to back it up.) The story goes like this. What Jinnah and the All-India Muslim League really wanted was a loosely federal India, with guaranteed representation for its Muslims and plenty of powers devolved to the states. But the Congress were all hopped up on soft socialism and hard centralism; to do what they wanted to do with India, they needed a strong and united national government. Still, they had a weakness: all of them, but Nehru especially, were romantic nationalists, Oedipal nationalists, dreamily sucking at the big milky breasts of Mother India. So Jinnah made what must have felt like a very clever bluff: he started talking about a separate state for a separate people, banking on the idea that Nehru would be so horrified—an elective mastectomy on Bharat Mata!—that he’d instantly cave. Instead, Nehru called his bluff. The man who’d written an entire weepy book on the mystic unity of India (titled <em>The Unity of India</em>, natch) ended up deciding that political power was actually more important. The country would probably run smoother without so many Muslims agitating for their slice, and it would absolutely run smoother without Jinnah. Congress started enthusiastically planning for partition, and at this point it was too late for Jinnah to back down. Whether he wanted it or not, he had a Pakistan. The All-India Muslim League had ended up tearing an entirely different country out of the Indus Valley and the Ganges Delta. Muhammad Ali Jinnah served as the first Governor-General of his accidental Pakistan for one year and one month until September 1948, at which point, tubercular and exhausted, he died.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64e4f071-afc0-4669-a1a7-430dd95f3180_2407x1805.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64e4f071-afc0-4669-a1a7-430dd95f3180_2407x1805.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64e4f071-afc0-4669-a1a7-430dd95f3180_2407x1805.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64e4f071-afc0-4669-a1a7-430dd95f3180_2407x1805.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64e4f071-afc0-4669-a1a7-430dd95f3180_2407x1805.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64e4f071-afc0-4669-a1a7-430dd95f3180_2407x1805.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/64e4f071-afc0-4669-a1a7-430dd95f3180_2407x1805.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2045734,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64e4f071-afc0-4669-a1a7-430dd95f3180_2407x1805.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64e4f071-afc0-4669-a1a7-430dd95f3180_2407x1805.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64e4f071-afc0-4669-a1a7-430dd95f3180_2407x1805.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64e4f071-afc0-4669-a1a7-430dd95f3180_2407x1805.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This might be one of the snotty, contrarian takes I’m famous for, but I think Partition was bad. </p><p>The old city of Amritsar is a strange and strangely unattractive place. There are some really beautiful old buildings in there: ornate mansions with stone goddesses carved into the niches, tall wood-fronted townhouses with the original paint still peeling off, some gorgeous Art Deco cinemas and graceful Bauhaus arcades. But away from the tarted-up main plazas, Amritsar is a dump. It’s mildly prosperous, but it looks like a slum. Most of the houses are in raw brick or crumbling cement, looking more like a pizza oven than a home. Slapdash, like they’d been put up in a few days and then left untouched to rot for the next few decades. I couldn’t understand what had happened, or why anyone would let all the grand old buildings be pulled down and replaced with something so obviously inferior. But the answer was obvious. In the months leading up to Partition, Amritsar’s Hindus and Sikhs ended up burning down their own city to force the Muslims out. Nearly half the buildings in the old town were totally destroyed. </p><p>Those brick and cement boxes were put up quickly out of the ruins to house the incoming refugees, because over in Amritsar’s sister city of Lahore, Muslims led by the civic police were doing exactly the same thing. They put bombs in drainage pipes to blow up entire neighbourhoods at once. When crowds of Hindus fled for the railway station, they were shot down on the platforms and their bodies heaped up on the tracks. In the countryside it was worse. As the last British troops left at midnight, every village they passed was in flames. These people had lived together, more or less peacefully, for hundreds of years; now they’d rather inherit a pile of ashes than spend another day in each other’s company. This violence wasn’t just ugly. Worse: it was <em>stupid</em>, even by the standards of massive mutual genocide. Shortly after Partition, a train carrying Muslim refugees to Pakistan was travelling through Amritsar when a mob of armed Sikhs opened fire. Once the guards were overpowered they moved through the carriages, systematically butchering everyone they found. Maybe three thousand men, women, and children were shot or hacked to death. These people were <em>already leaving</em>. All the mob had to do was nothing, and the refugees would have disappeared over the border forever. But by 1947, killing had become a routine, a sport, and a comfort. Everyone was either killing or dying. Why <em>not</em> these people? Who are they, that they should get to live?</p><p>When the smoke finally cleared, Jinnah’s big clever bluff had left maybe two million people dead. They died for a country no one actually wanted, which hadn’t even existed as an idea fifteen years beforehand, which came into being by accident, as part of a bargaining strategy that didn’t work, between one London lawyer who trained at the Inner Temple and one London lawyer who trained at Lincoln’s Inn. The most disastrous poker game in human history. But for the dead, at least, that was the end of their indignity. Pity the survivors: instead of dying for Pakistan, they had to live in it. </p><p>Pakistan is a stupid country. It does not work. It does not make sense. It was a product of the League, but the base of the League’s support wasn’t anywhere near the areas that ended up becoming Pakistan: it was among educated Muslims in Bombay, Calcutta, and what’s now Uttar Pradesh. But the new state had to be carved out of the areas where Muslims were a <em>majority</em>, not where most Muslims actually lived, which is why it ended up containing almost none of the historical centres of Muslim India. Jinnah himself described it as a ‘maimed, mutilated, and moth-eaten’ country. Jinnah’s life is a good illustration: he might have been born in Karachi, and died there too, but he had absolutely nothing to do with the place or its people: his family were from Gujarat, he spent most of his life in Bombay and London, and he preferred to speak English. Urdu, which became Pakistan’s national language, isn’t even native to any of the country’s regions; it’s the Persianised dialect of Hindustani that once served as the court language of the Mughals at Delhi and Agra. The entire Pakistani project rests on the assumption that a Punjabi Muslim and a Bengali Muslim belong to the same nation, but a Punjabi Muslim and a Punjabi Sikh do not, and a Bengali Muslim and a Bengali Hindu don’t either. This is obviously very dumb, but the security and integrity of the state depended on nobody noticing. When they did notice, the result was predictable. Another genocide, since the first had turned out so well.</p><p>One of the most interesting takes on the Pakistani project is Faisal Devji’s <em>Muslim Zion: Pakistan as a Political Idea</em>. The book is one long exercise in drawing out the analogy between Pakistan and Israel. Some of the little historical rhymes really are startling. (Did you know Israel’s law allowing the state to plunder the assets of Palestinians who fled during the Nakba was practically a word-for-word copy of Pakistan’s law seizing the assets of fleeing Hindus?) But the core of Devji’s argument is that Pakistan and Israel are the only two countries in the world that have tried to build an artificial national identity not out of any definite geography or any particular ethnic group, but solely on the basis of religion. Like Ben Gurion, Jinnah the eater of ham sandwiches wanted his new country to be secular. In the first days of his new state, he announced his hope that ‘Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the state.’ Which is a nice idea. It might have even worked out, if he hadn’t literally just founded an entire state on Islam as a political category.</p><p>Pakistani secularism was not workable. The only thing holding this confederation of Sindhis, Bengalis, Balochis, Punjabis, and Pashtuns together was Islam, but when the state refused to make use of it, what held them together was, essentially, nothing. It didn’t take long for some Bengalis in East Pakistan to figure out that they actually made up the majority of the new country, but its official language was Urdu and not Bengali, and its capital was in Karachi and not Dhaka. In fact, they appeared to live in an enclave more than a thousand miles away from their compatriots, with the great mass of India in between. What gives? In the 1954 election, an alliance led by the Bengali nationalist All-Pakistan Awami League came to power. (<em>All</em> seems to have a different meaning in the Indian subcontinent.) In 1958, they were overthrown in a military coup. This was probably inevitable; a nice normal democracy is basically impossible in these conditions. But they tried again, and in 1970 the Awami League won the elections outright, gaining enough seats to govern the whole of Pakistan. (Imagine if Northern Ireland had more people than the rest of the UK put together, and Sinn Féin won a majority in Westminster.) But the President refused to open parliament until he’d hashed out some kind of deal to keep the Awami League from power, and in the meantime, the military seized cities across East Pakistan and started killing. They went door to door, identifying Hindus by forcibly stripping the men: anyone uncircumcised was executed on the spot. They rounded up the faculty at Dhaka University, along with any journalists, playwrights, poets, filmmakers, and teachers they could get their hands on, and shot them too. Over the course of the nine-month war that followed, Pakistan exterminated up to three million of its own citizens in the Ganges Delta. It wasn’t enough. In the end, they were forced to grant independence to their eastern province. The Bengali Muslims were finally free and united, in their own, almost entirely homogenous territory. The new nation of Bangladesh has obviously faced absolutely no major political problems since.</p><p>Pakistan learned its lesson, but in the worst possible way. Slowly after the war, and then very quickly after another military coup in 1977, the country turned itself into a petty, cretinous, and resentful confessional state. Today, the Pakistani constitution has a raft of provisions against the tiny, harmless Ahmadiyya sect. To apply for a Pakistani passport, you have to sign a declaration affirming that Ahmadiyyas are a false and heretical cult. Ahmadiyyas themselves are forbidden from calling themselves Muslim, calling their place of worship a masjid, or saying <em>as-salaamu aleykum</em> to each other, all on pain of imprisonment or death. Pakistan also reserves the right to kill you if you have sex outside of marriage, engage in any kind of homosexuality, or ‘defile the name of the Prophet Mohammed.’ So far, nobody has actually been executed under Pakistan’s blasphemy laws, but this might be because people accused of blasphemy are routinely dragged out of their jail cells and physically torn apart by screaming, spittle-flecked mobs. But the sentence has been handed down. A doctor was sentenced to death for saying that since Mohammed’s parents died before the advent of Islam, they were therefore non-Muslims. A schizophrenic old man started saying he was a prophet of God: he was arrested, imprisoned, and then killed with a gunshot to the back. A Christian villager was constantly pressured by her neighbours to convert to Islam; when she told one of them that she believed her religion was right and Islam was wrong she was imprisoned and sentenced to death. Two Pakistani politicians who criticised the verdict and the country’s blasphemy laws were assassinated, one by his own bodyguard. That bodyguard became a cause célèbre. Huge protests across the country demanding his release. When the state hanged him anyway, his grave became a major pilgrimage site.</p><p>With the country’s internal identity nicely secured, Pakistan found its international role as a shadowy go-between for the American world-empire in its dealings with the forces of international jihad. The result is that for much of its recent history, Pakistan has been covertly governed by its own intelligence agencies. This is not always great for the people of Pakistan, who have been repeatedly blown up, shot down, or overrun by various fanatical ISI-proxy militias for whom Pakistan’s deranged Islamist constitution is simply not Islamic enough. But at least all this deadly piety must have papered over the country’s ethnic divides, right? Not really. A few weeks before I arrived in the subcontinent, ethnic militants stopped a bus in Balochistan, demanded everyone’s ID cards, pulled all the non-Balochi passengers off the bus, and shot them by the side of the road. Pakistan is a stupid country. It does not work. It does not make sense.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03b836ee-8c8f-44a0-a2c2-4cd87bb9938d_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03b836ee-8c8f-44a0-a2c2-4cd87bb9938d_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03b836ee-8c8f-44a0-a2c2-4cd87bb9938d_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03b836ee-8c8f-44a0-a2c2-4cd87bb9938d_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03b836ee-8c8f-44a0-a2c2-4cd87bb9938d_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03b836ee-8c8f-44a0-a2c2-4cd87bb9938d_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/03b836ee-8c8f-44a0-a2c2-4cd87bb9938d_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2493934,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03b836ee-8c8f-44a0-a2c2-4cd87bb9938d_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03b836ee-8c8f-44a0-a2c2-4cd87bb9938d_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03b836ee-8c8f-44a0-a2c2-4cd87bb9938d_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03b836ee-8c8f-44a0-a2c2-4cd87bb9938d_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The punchline, though, is that all of the above also applies to India.</p><p>India was also left in a basically nonsensical position after Partition. Supposedly, Pakistan was the religious breakaway state, while India inherited the grand tradition of subcontinental pluralism running from Ashoka to Akbar. Notionally, India was for everyone: Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, the Buddhists in the mountains, the Parsis with their vultures, the Christian tribes in the northeast, the tribe of lost Jews shipwrecked on the Malabar Coast. A very nice thought. But everyone knew, whether or not they said it outright, that India was for the Hindus. The independence struggle had been cast in explicitly Hindu terms from the start, and once Partition got going, Congress certainly acted like they were building a Hindu state. They did everything in their power to make sure the North-West Frontier Province—a region on the Afghan border, overwhelmingly Muslim, but also firmly loyal to an undivided India—ended up in Pakistan. Just like in Pakistan, Indian politics have increasingly veered towards bitter religious chauvinism. Instead of mobs tearing people apart on suspicion of insulting the Prophet, India has cow vigilantes: mobs tearing people apart on suspicion of eating beef, justified by the principle of non-violence towards all living beings. The state has a habit of ordering the demolition of historic mosques, on the grounds that there was a Hindu temple on the same site before the first Islamic invasions one thousand years ago. But the ugly, violent, fascoid Hindu nationalism that has ended up dominating Indian politics is just an explicit articulation of what had always been there, just below the surface, all along.</p><p>India, just like Pakistan, is an invention. Before 1947, there had never been a unified Hindu state encompassing all of India’s present-day territory. But for more than a century, from 1733 to 1849, there <em>was</em> a Sikh state, controlling a huge swathe of land from its base in the Punjab. So how come the Muslims get a country and the Hindus get a country, but the Sikhs don’t?</p><p>Like a lot of British people, my primary encounter with Sikhism comes from stumbling home after a big night out in London and seeing the Sikh Action teams doling out free food for the homeless. The langar, or community kitchen, has a central position in Sikh religious life, which is a pretty good first impression for any religion to make: I won’t pretend it hasn’t subtly biased me. Sikhs revere ten gurus, starting with Guru Nanak, the founder of the religion; the eleventh and immortal guru is the Granth, the holy book, which is why its proper title is Guru Granth Sahib. As a member of another religion of the Book, this also appeals to me. I’ve not read all of Guru Granth Sahib—each copy consists of 1,430 enormous, densely crowded pages of theology and hymns—but I liked Guru Nanak’s dialogues with the Hindu sages in the <em>Sidh Gosht</em>. He comes off like a sincere, thoughtful, good-humoured, gregarious, occasionally slightly cheeky guy. I’m not sure why, but Sikhs are visibly taller than their Hindu or Muslim compatriots, and I like being among them; it makes me feel a little less like a circus freak in this country. I also like the Golden Temple in Amritsar, which is absolutely the most beautiful thing in a fairly ugly city. Amritsar is hot; stiflingly hot. The Punjabi plains are flat for miles in every direction around, and the hot air sits motionless on top of everything, the noise, the dust, the dull sunlight bludgeoning you from every surface. But the Golden Temple is calm and quiet and cool. Inside the temple itself, granthis are constantly singing from the Guru Granth Sahib; the calming drone of Sikh leyning, with a harmonium and tabla accompaniment, is piped around the complex. You walk clockwise around the pool, and every so often someone deposits a sweet buttery plop of karah parshad into your cupped hands. Everything is so tidy, and everyone is so welcoming, and all the buildings are so finely decorated in marble and gold. Hard to believe that just forty years ago, it took three divisions of the Indian Army five days under heavy fire to blast this place into rubble. </p><p>But this is what happens when people start asking the question. How <em>come</em> the Muslims get a country and the Hindus get a country, but the Sikhs don’t? In 1947, Sikh bands were hunting Muslim villagers like rabbits across the countryside; by the 1980s the Hindu-Sikh alliance had soured. A generation of young, fiercely religious men were demanding Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland that would, once formed, cause all major political problems to disappear. Some of them were hoping to achieve this through the subcontinent’s favourite political tactic: hijacking buses and executing any passengers belonging to the wrong group. Meanwhile, a young activist called Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale was invited to take up residence in the Golden Temple complex. Bhindranwale started walking around with a revolver and an ammo belt. Sikhs traditionally wear a dagger; he explained that he was just conforming to religious dress. But his followers were stockpiling grenade launchers and anti-tank guns, and occasionally taking potshots at the police from within the temple grounds. Outside its walls, Indira Gandhi had dismissed the Punjabi government and assumed direct rule. Tanks were moving into Amritsar. Inside, pilgrims continued to pour into the temple to walk clockwise around the Parikrama, chant along to philosophical disquisitions on the oneness of God, and accept ritual hospitality in the form of a handful of buttery pap. On the first of June, 1984, the Army attacked. They’d expected token resistance; instead hundreds of soldiers were mown down as they tried to approach the temple. Three days later they tried again. This time they pounded the holiest site in Sikhism with artillery and strafed it from helicopters. Survivors saw entire families gunned down under the Laachi Ber, the tree in whose shade Guru Arjan once sat to watch the temple being constructed. Body parts floating in the Pool of the Nectar of Immortality. </p><p>Afterwards, what used to be Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale lay mangled in the rubble, along with most of his followers, much of the temple’s clerical leadership, and anywhere up to ten thousand pilgrims who happened to be visiting the temple at the wrong time. A few months later, as Indira Gandhi was on her way to be interviewed by Peter Ustinov, she was gunned down by her own Sikh bodyguards. Another bodyguard, who arrested the assassins, was also Sikh. (The general who’d led the assault on the Golden Temple was Sikh too.) But that night, mobs in Delhi whipped up by Congress politicians descended on city buses. Another round of India’s national sport. Anyone wearing a turban was dragged out, doused in kerosene, and burned alive.</p><p>Amritsar might be peaceful now, but the struggle still isn’t finished. Last year, someone shot and killed a Canadian Sikh activist called Hardeep Singh Nijjar outside a gurdwara in British Columbia. Canada accused the Indian government of masterminding his assassination; India issued a denial. The British government, desperate for a post-Brexit trade deal with India, announced that it was working closely with Delhi to combat ‘Khalistan extremism.’ Britain is also a stupid country.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41f3393e-eab2-4822-9512-e35813c25b07_3024x2268.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41f3393e-eab2-4822-9512-e35813c25b07_3024x2268.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41f3393e-eab2-4822-9512-e35813c25b07_3024x2268.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41f3393e-eab2-4822-9512-e35813c25b07_3024x2268.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41f3393e-eab2-4822-9512-e35813c25b07_3024x2268.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41f3393e-eab2-4822-9512-e35813c25b07_3024x2268.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/41f3393e-eab2-4822-9512-e35813c25b07_3024x2268.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2574615,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41f3393e-eab2-4822-9512-e35813c25b07_3024x2268.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41f3393e-eab2-4822-9512-e35813c25b07_3024x2268.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41f3393e-eab2-4822-9512-e35813c25b07_3024x2268.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41f3393e-eab2-4822-9512-e35813c25b07_3024x2268.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Of all the possible ways Indian independence could have turned out, I think it’s hard to imagine anything worse than what actually happened.</p><p>When people regret Partition, they usually mean that there should have been a united, secular South Asia, where no one religious or ethnic group could ever claim ownership of the state. And I agree: that would have been much better. But I don’t know if it was ever really possible. Historically, the main factor that reliably keeps hostile populations quiet is a big external empire. Instead of engaging in recreational massacre, they compete to win the favour of the imperial court. Europe has experienced unprecedented peace, ever since it became an outpost of the American empire. Armenians and Azeris were good neighbours until the Soviet Union started to crumble. (This is why I now support a one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the state in question being the People’s Republic of China. Let the CCP billet hundreds of friendly Han Chinese students in every refugee camp and every Haredi suburb. Teach them to make hong shao rou.) Returning to British rule is not really a great idea, and not only because we can barely govern ourselves these days. But what about going in the other direction? What if, instead of these two narrow, sectional, totalising, all-consuming states, India had become a patchwork of dozens or hundreds of tiny, teeming, strange new forms? Mumbai could have been a Parsi Singapore on the Arabian Sea, Towers of Silence crowning the skyscrapers, maybe surrounded by a confederation of anarchist neo-Buddhist Dalit communes. People’s republics in the south, feudal fiefdoms in the deserts. A Sikh theocracy in the Punjab, sure, but we can get weirder than that. How about a Jain Kingdom of the Birds, maybe governed in collaboration with effective-altruist types in the West, where half the government budget is spent on solving the problems of wild animal suffering? Lots of mosquito nets, but if a bloodsucking insect does land on you, you’re legally required to let it feed. Maybe another Jewish state in the backwaters of Kochi. A more laid-back, tropical Zion, since the one in the Middle East didn’t work out so well. Maybe sovereign ashrams, nuclear-armed lamaseries, a Vatican for every god in the pantheon. Devotional cults running their own enlightened utopias. Hippie republics where all political power belongs to the rivers and the trees.</p><p>This really could have happened, or at least something a bit more like it. For a brief moment in 1947, Mountbatten was genuinely considering something called Plan Balkan, which would have split India into maybe a dozen independent countries. Handily, some of those countries already existed. In the Partition Museum in Amritsar, I saw the map above, printed on the eve of independence. You’ll notice that in addition to India and Pakistan, the map contains some hefty chunks of land that don’t seem to belong to either. These are the princely states, a patchwork of weird local monarchies that Britain chose to leave in place during the Raj. Some of these minor despotisms had survived for hundreds of years, through the Mughals and the Marathas and the East India Company and the Raj, but in the end they couldn’t survive independence. After all, they were a reminder that India had never really been united. Theoretically, the various maharajas, sultans, nawabs, and nizams could choose whether they wanted to homogenise their lands into India or Pakistan. In practice, there was no choice at all. Junagadh was a kingdom in present-day Gujarat whose mostly Hindu population had been ruled by the Muslim Babi dynasty since 1654. In 1947, the reigning Babi decided he wanted to join Pakistan. Nehru decided otherwise. He sent in the troops. You couldn’t have Muslim states with Hindu populations any more. No weird gnarls in the land. The Portuguese enclave in Goa, which had existed since 1510—making it one of the oldest continuously existing political entities on the subcontinent—ended up being forcibly ‘returned’ to an artificial Indian state that had come into existence, essentially, yesterday. Maybe the most shameful campaign was the annexation of Hyderabad. In 1947, the Nizam of Hyderabad decided that he didn’t want to join either India or Pakistan. He was another Muslim monarch ruling over a mostly Hindu populace, but his state was bigger than most European countries, with its own languages, its own currency, and a standing army of tens of thousands in shiny uniforms. But the Indians had an air force, and they managed to conquer an area larger than Great Britain in less than five days, with single-digit fatalities on the Indian side. At this point, you probably won’t be surprised by what happened next. Tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of Hyderabadi Muslims were rounded up, in families, in great undifferentiated masses, and killed.</p><p>The biggest of the princely states, though, was Jammu and Kashmir. Its Maharajah was Hindu, but most of his subjects were Muslim: he wanted independence, but according to the Junagadh precedent, his lands should have gone to Pakistan. However, Nehru’s ancestors had come from the Kashmiri Hindu elite, and he’d developed a sentimental attachment to the place. In <em>The Unity of India</em> he gushes in embarrassing, erotic tones. ‘Like some supremely beautiful woman, such is Kashmir in all its feminine beauty of river and valley and lake and graceful trees.’ But as India descended into violence, a horde of Pashtun militia from Pakistan surged into Kashmir to overthrow the Maharajah and massacre any Hindus they could find. By this point Nehru was regularly crying out like a toddler: ‘I want Kashmir! I want Kashmir!’ So India produced a document of accession from the Maharajah, and sent in the troops. Pakistan claimed the document had been forged—according to most historians, it probably was—and sent in its own forces. These two countries had only existed for a few months—both armies were still commanded by British officers, and both officially claimed to be fighting in the service of the Queen—but they were already at war.</p><p>Today, Kashmir is still divided between two occupation zones. Indian-controlled Kashmir has seen nearly eighty years of war, insurgency, torture, and murder, as the state tries to keep hold of a people who simply do not want to be part of this country. It’s still possible that India and Pakistan might wipe each other out with nuclear weapons over the snowy peaks and grassy valleys that Nehru was so desperate to fuck. In both countries, people are entirely unreasonable about Kashmir. Here in India, for instance, it’s a criminal offence to display a map that doesn’t put the entire territory in India. Online, people who innocently post ordinary world maps (which put the border at the Line of Control), often in completely different contexts, are mobbed by Indian nationalists begging them to take down this inaccurate and insulting representation. One particularly funny upshot is that in Bollywood action films, the Pakistani villains are always poring over maps of their country that don’t include any part of Kashmir.</p><p>Politically, I don’t endorse the rule of nizams and maharajahs. But the princely states still strike me as a far saner model than the fake, totalising ethno-religious states of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Unlike all these other invented communities, the princely states never pretended to be anything other than artificial. All they represent is the territory that someone’s great-great-grandfather managed to conquer in the mid-eighteenth century. There’s no notion that all our political problems could be solved if only our political units conform to ‘natural’ social divisions. Political problems are just what we get for being political animals. No separate states for separate peoples, blank, conformist, but a lattice of political forms overlaid on the country essentially at random. A lot more borders, but every border would be like Wagah: a performance, a piece of theatre, self-evidently ridiculous, just like the state itself. This is not a utopian idea. It really existed, in one form or another, for hundreds of years, and it worked. Well, sort of. The various states were constantly at war with each other. But their uniforms looked great, and they could moan for a really long time. At least it wasn’t dull. </p>

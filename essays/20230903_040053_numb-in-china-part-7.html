While China claims to be pursuing socialism with Chinese characteristics, a form of socialism that responds to China’s distinct culture and history, it’s been pointed out that those Chinese characteristics bear a striking resemblance to ordinary global capitalism. Is the red flag still flying here? Are the proletarians in control? What’s the difference between socialism with a straight face, and socialism with a wink?</em></p><p><em>From now until mid-September, Numb at the Lodge will be in China, investigating these questions and more.

Today, the place has fully kitted itself out in the garb of the Cultural Revolution. There’s an enormous white marble statue of Mao in the town square, flanked by portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. There are public loudspeakers on every street, and every morning they play <em>The East is Red</em>. Apparently, workers still engage in lengthy after-work political education sessions. Obviously, I had to go.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Nanjie is officially a village, but it doesn’t much look like one. On three sides, the place is surrounded by the town of Linying, which looks exactly like every other medium-sized Chinese town, which is to say that it’s utter chaos. Half-built concrete skyscrapers poking like spears of asparagus out of empty, sandy lots. Cracked uneven pavements that stop abruptly for no reason, or which are crowded with parked scooters at such a density that it’s impossible to actually walk down them. Neon lights; street vendors barking. Mahjong games that attract so many silent, spitting septuagenarian spectators they block off major arterial roads. Just by the entrance to Nanjie, there’s a big Tang dynasty-themed shopping plaza, complete with a huge luminous ferris wheel and a bunch of other thrilling rides that for some reason were playing, in place of the usual funfair music, Elliott Smith. And then you pass through the gate, and you’re in another world.</p><p>At its edges Nanjie is trimmed with squares and parks, all of which are immaculate. Lush green grass, spotless beautiful plazas. There’s a cultural garden featuring a life-sized recreation of the house where Mao grew up and the one he occupied in Yan’an after the Long March. The big statue of the man himself gleams like a mirror on sunny days. At night, they play music here and the locals waltz in pairs, while their kids ride their tricycles and play with their toy trucks under the wry, crinkle-eyed portrait of Josef Stalin. Nobody is selling anything. It’s all very unsettling, but also very undeniably <em>nice</em>. The rest of the place is a different story. </p><p>Some of the workers live in bare-brick dormitories; others in low apartment blocks with cracked tiles. No high-rises here. But the majority of the town is taken up by industry, much of it in varying stages of decay. Huge concrete smokestacks with saplings growing out of the spouts. Broken windows, half-paved streets. Inside the walls of a derelict power plant the ground had been furrowed for vegetables, and someone was raising a small herd of ducks by a pond. It was in the industrial zone that I started getting followed.</p><p>At first I only noticed one kid trailing me on his electric scooter. Maybe seventeen years old, skinny, serious-looking. He must have thought he was being subtle. I’d lumber around like the big foreign tourist I am, poking at abandoned factories, taking photos, and his scooter would whir almost-silently behind me. If I turned around he’d speed off down the wide empty road and then wait nonchalantly at the next corner to start following me again. I started to take weird turns and double back on myself—but not only did I fail to shake him, soon there were three of them tracking me, all whispering urgently. I started having horrible visions of the three of them proudly bursting in to the local militia office—<em>Comrades! We caught a Western imperialist spy!</em>—and slapping my severed head on the desk. I decided that to prevent things getting to that stage, I had to confront them. It didn’t really matter what I said, I reasoned, since none of them would speak any English; the important thing was to project absolute confidence with just enough of an undercurrent of menace. So at the next corner I marched directly up to the three kids on their scooters and said, in the most intimidating voice I could muster, oi! Can I help you?</p><p>One of them could, in fact, speak English. But he was pretty confused.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a4e8f46-3c90-4d6e-b9e0-73290fa89e1f_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a4e8f46-3c90-4d6e-b9e0-73290fa89e1f_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a4e8f46-3c90-4d6e-b9e0-73290fa89e1f_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a4e8f46-3c90-4d6e-b9e0-73290fa89e1f_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a4e8f46-3c90-4d6e-b9e0-73290fa89e1f_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a4e8f46-3c90-4d6e-b9e0-73290fa89e1f_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a4e8f46-3c90-4d6e-b9e0-73290fa89e1f_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:380567,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a4e8f46-3c90-4d6e-b9e0-73290fa89e1f_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a4e8f46-3c90-4d6e-b9e0-73290fa89e1f_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a4e8f46-3c90-4d6e-b9e0-73290fa89e1f_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a4e8f46-3c90-4d6e-b9e0-73290fa89e1f_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>My new friends explained that they were, of course, just fascinated to see a Westerner wandering around in their town, and they’d wanted to know what had brought me from so far away to the muddy heart of Henan, but they were too bashful to just ask. What on earth was I doing here? To be honest, I wasn’t entirely sure myself. I told them that I was, to some lingering degree I still hadn’t fully worked out yet, a communist, and that I was interested to see this last bastion of Chinese communism with my own eyes. That just confused them further. </p><p>They asked where I was from, and I told them. England, so cool, the one who could speak English said. We love England, we love ai ding bao. Now I was puzzled. Ball? I said. Like football? He shook his head. Ai ding bao, he said, we love ai ding bao because we love Harry Potter. A light glimmered. Ah, I said, <em>Edinburgh</em>. They nodded excitedly. Yes, yes, ai ding bao, so cool. Then they asked me if I liked Pepsi, and how much a bottle cost in my country. About twelve yuan, I said. Their mouths tightened into tiny fascinated points. But, I added, it might be more now, I left a month ago and the prices keep going up. They ahhhed as if rampant inflation were some luxury prestige good that hadn’t yet made it to China. So <em>cool</em>.</p><p>The teens insisted on buying me dinner at a noodle shop across the line in Linying. The one who spoke English—his name was He—was about to start university; he’d be studying hydraulic engineering in a town in Shaanxi province he’d never even visited before. The others would probably stay in Nanjie and work in a factory. If they were jealous they didn’t show it. They really couldn’t understand what I’d meant when I said I was a communist. What could that even mean, when England was already rich and already had Harry Potter?</p><p>What I learned is that Nanjie is not, in fact, the last village in China still living under Mao-era communism. It can’t be; the concept doesn’t make sense; you might as well talk about an English village where Charles is still an absolute monarch. Nanjie is something much more ordinary: a company town. The local government operates a private company, Nanjie Village Group, which employs all the village’s residents. (NVG mostly produces packaged instant noodles: that’s what the blue-shirted workers are making in their sternly decomposing factories. Meals for lonely commuters and people who play videogames all day.) Wages are low for China, extremely low, but NVG supplies its workers with free housing, free healthcare, free energy, free groceries, free weddings, and, eventually, free funerals. As a result, Nanjie residents have a generally better quality of life than most other villagers in Henan, whose rents keep increasing and who might lose everything if they get ill. Nanjie, I came to realise, is for the people who would rather not have to deal with all the intense <em>stress</em> of contemporary China. The noise and competition, the constant hustling to get rich, the awful consequences of staying poor. In Nanjie, you might have to work long hours, but afterwards you can waltz in the square. You will be <em>taken care of</em>. But to express that kind of vaguely humane ideal, you have to pretend to be harking back to the days when kids younger than my new friends were systematically torturing and murdering their elders and each other. You have to put up posters of Stalin, because in China, that’s the best available vernacular. We’re not just trying to eke out a living with as much dignity as possible, it says: actually, we’re in the revolutionary struggle for communism.</p><p>Nanjie does have its quirks. There really are loudspeakers along all the streets, and they really do play <em>The East is Red</em> every morning. But most of the public messaging isn’t political at all. Soft plinky piano, and a gentle soothing female voice; I managed to translate a few snippets. The treatment of knee joint pain is very important, she was saying, and daily maintenance is also very important. Strengthening the knee joint helps you resist wind and cold. Later, she said that I should look at myself in the mirror every day, and tell myself that I’m still great.</p><p>Since 1977, the village secretary has been one Wang Hongbin, who appears to have masterminded its transformation. There’s a minor personality cult around Wang, but in 2011 he was nearly ousted, and only kept his job after performing a self-criticism in front of village cadres. This was because he’d wasted tens of millions of yuan of village funds trying to produce a perpetual motion machine. He thought that developing perpetual motion would be good for Nanjie’s image: another triumph of collectivisation! He couldn’t see why it was so impossible, especially when Nanjie had so many engineers, and when villagers started droning on about the laws of thermodynamics, he simply ignored them. During his self-criticism, Wang acknowledged that the project had been a mistake. But a few years later, he was winking to journalists about a secret programme he was working on. All very hush-hush, naturally, but he hinted that Nanjie would shortly be unveiling ‘the world’s first form of clean energy.’ Eyes sparkling with excitement. He knew what he was working on, and he knew we knew too: he’s building another perpetual motion machine. So close, so deliciously close to being achieved, and then the whole world will know his name…</p><p>Despite the obvious silliness of the place, I wasn’t the only visitor there. Nanjie has become a major ‘red tourism’ destination; in peak season, busloads of people arrive daily to gawp at this fragment of the road not taken. (A few villagers could probably triple their earnings if they sold some plastic Maoist kitsch on the street—but then that would break the illusion.) But I think the reason Nanjie is so popular isn’t really to do with Communist nostalgia at all. What Nanjie is producing alongside its noodles is a quota-busting surplus of <em>camp</em>: this ordinary village that’s turned itself into a Maoist Disneyland. What entices people isn’t the illusion of a China that’s still socialist, but the <em>fakery itself</em>: its ability to project official ideology in a way that’s over-the-top, yes-really-but-no-not-really, campy, ironic: as a sort of game.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17fd66f0-3f9a-418c-b409-441437b00983_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17fd66f0-3f9a-418c-b409-441437b00983_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17fd66f0-3f9a-418c-b409-441437b00983_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17fd66f0-3f9a-418c-b409-441437b00983_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17fd66f0-3f9a-418c-b409-441437b00983_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17fd66f0-3f9a-418c-b409-441437b00983_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/17fd66f0-3f9a-418c-b409-441437b00983_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:217270,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17fd66f0-3f9a-418c-b409-441437b00983_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17fd66f0-3f9a-418c-b409-441437b00983_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17fd66f0-3f9a-418c-b409-441437b00983_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17fd66f0-3f9a-418c-b409-441437b00983_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>But as everyone in the West is convinced, the rest of China is playing the exact same game. It’s not hard to make the most obvious argument for why China is no longer in any meaningful sense a socialist economy; I’ve had a lot of fun making it myself. All you have to do is go to some huge gaudy luxury theme mall, spread your arms wide, and go ah! Red China! The People’s Republic! Finally, I have tasted the air of communism! Here I am, in the revolutionary workers’ and peasants’ state, where the toiling masses have seized the reins of history! Most of the time, you’ll find that the government has put up a big hammer and sickle within eyeshot of a flagship Gucci store, and the wonderful irony of it all will keep you smug for weeks.</p><p>This is, obviously, a bit facile; nobody ever said that socialism means nobody is allowed to have nice handbags. (Actually, plenty of people <em>have</em> said this, but most of them can be safely ignored.) There are other suspicious factors that seem to place China among the capitalist economies, though, like the privatisation of housing and healthcare; personally, I’d add pedestrians not having the right of way on Chinese roads. But really, it depends on your definition of <em>socialism</em>. In China, there are inescapable displays in every town listing the ‘twelve core values of socialism,’ which are prosperity, democracy, civility, harmony, freedom, equality, justice, rule of law, patriotism, integrity, dedication, and friendship. Not on the list: workers’ power, class struggle, internationalism, the materialist conception of history, or the production of use-values rather than exchange-values. </p><p>But maybe my notion is too narrow. For a loose coalition of squishy social democrats and deranged anarcho-capitalists, socialism is basically whenever the state has any kind of involvement in the economy whatsoever. Strangely, the Communist Party of China is also part of that coalition. The CPC Constitution helpfully explains that socialism is ‘the basic economic system whereby public ownership plays a dominant role and economic entities under diverse forms of ownership develop side by side.’ And it’s true that in China, a significant proportion of the economy is taken up by state-owned enterprises, which can operate in non-market-directed ways to influence the prices of various essential commodities and pump capital into underdeveloped regions. What I really like about this definition of socialism is that it’s <em>quantifiable</em>. While it’s hard to say exactly how much of the Chinese economy is taken up by state-owned enterprises, since China doesn’t publish the relevant data, in 2019 a World Bank analysis came up with the figure of 23.1%. In France, meanwhile, SOEs contribute 17.8% of GDP. In other words, the Communist Party of China, vanguard of the Chinese working class, carrying the torch of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao, the revolutionary party whose ‘highest ideal and ultimate goal is the realisation of communism,’ is roughly 1.3 times more socialist than Emmanuel Macron.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe03c4d18-adf0-4ab0-91a7-8cae6b521233_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe03c4d18-adf0-4ab0-91a7-8cae6b521233_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe03c4d18-adf0-4ab0-91a7-8cae6b521233_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe03c4d18-adf0-4ab0-91a7-8cae6b521233_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe03c4d18-adf0-4ab0-91a7-8cae6b521233_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe03c4d18-adf0-4ab0-91a7-8cae6b521233_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e03c4d18-adf0-4ab0-91a7-8cae6b521233_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:461436,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe03c4d18-adf0-4ab0-91a7-8cae6b521233_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe03c4d18-adf0-4ab0-91a7-8cae6b521233_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe03c4d18-adf0-4ab0-91a7-8cae6b521233_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe03c4d18-adf0-4ab0-91a7-8cae6b521233_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>There’s a nicely contrarian theory that explains a lot of this. According to classical Marxist account, capitalism develops out of feudalism with the rise of the bourgeoisie, but it’s only a transitional phase; eventually its internal contradictions produce a revolutionary working-class communist movement that abolishes capitalism and builds something else in its place. All very neat. But the actual history of global communism, writers like Branko Milanović argue, indicates something different: communism, in practice, was never an anti-capitalist movement, and always an anti-<em>feudal</em> movement. Instead of being the natural successor to capitalism in the advanced Western states, communism allowed the under-developed economies of the imperial periphery to lay the groundwork for an indigenous capitalism of their own. It takes immense violence and rupture, but communism, with its mass mobilisations and rural collectivisation, is capable of breaking up all the ‘feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations’ that the colonial regimes—which were mostly just concerned with resource extraction—left untouched. Communism wrenches open the patriarchal family, emancipates women, slaughters landlords, attacks religion, and casts an atmosphere of suspicion and terror over ordinary social relations—all of which ends up supplying an enormous pool of free labour for future capitalist industry. Communism allows a local capitalism to get off the ground without being outcompeted by imperialist capital; it makes a country <em>fearsome</em>, armed to the teeth and capable of sacrificing large numbers of its own people to fend off any attempt to force open its markets from more technologically advanced powers. Communism is a bourgeois revolution in a box, and you don’t even need a bourgeoisie to make it work: simply open it up, switch it on, and in thirty years all the picturesque poverty and peasants with interesting weatherbeaten faces will be gone, and your shiny new capitalist economy will enjoy double-digit growth. Only three countries have more than tripled their per-capita GDP since 1991: the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the People’s Democratic Republic of Laos, and the People’s Republic of China.</p><p>The Communist Party of China does not agree. Instead, their position is the deterministic orthodox Marxist one: they really are building a classless society, but to get to communism, you have to pass through capitalism first. The CPC hopes to have completed its developmental goals by the hundredth anniversary of the Revolution in 2049. At that point, all the sadly necessary dross of capitalism will wither away like an empty chrysalis, its purpose having been served. No more luxury malls with their Gucci stores or glass skyscrapers full of bankers. The street hawkers will no longer need to bark and plead for their livelihoods. The children will no longer be entranced by cheap lurid crap on their screens. The hypercool cyberteens will abandon their games of status. The factory labourers will instantly go from working seventy-two-hour weeks to producing for the same reason artists do: because to be human is to transform the world. The atrocities will be named and forgiven. In the noodle bars, full of men eating alone, in silence, staring at their screens, everyone will suddenly stand up and embrace each other as brothers, and then walk together into a new, liberated, beautiful world, where Isaac need not quarrel with Esau because the earth and its abundance belong to all.</p><p>I’m told they really do believe this, fully and sincerely. Maybe desperately. If you can’t believe in the eventual transition to communism, what was it <em>for</em>, the nightmare of China’s twentieth century? Just money? Just a society of grasping traumatised grifters, who have no other goal than getting rich? The CPC’s greatest terror is <em>nihilism</em>. It was nihilism, in their analysis, that destroyed the Soviet Union: as soon as Khrushchev denounced Stalin’s crimes, all faith in the system fell apart; the ruling cadres ended up believing in nothing, and the people believed in nothing too; eventually everyone simply stopped pretending, dropped the communist pretence, and embraced sheer nihilism as the governing philosophy of state and society. You <em>have</em> to believe, because the other option isn’t nice Western liberalism; it’s the void. Which is why China is committed to building a ‘socialist spiritual civilisation,’ a mass uniform ideological enthusiasm for whatever it is that passes here for socialism. Which is why China does not dwell on the evils of its past, even if the enforced silence over events well within living memory breeds a nihilism of its own. Which is why the people who govern China, one of the most cynically capitalist societies on the planet, <em>really do believe</em> that they are on the road to communism. </p><p>In other words, the Communist Party of China are <em>Mensheviks</em>.</p><p>It’s been a long, strange road, but their heirs of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao are now the heirs of Pavel Axelrod and Julius Martov. A century ago, in the months of chaos between the February and October Revolutions, the Bolsheviks pushed for an immediate transition to socialism, while the Mensheviks kept insisting that a proletarian revolution was doomed to fail until Russia had gone through all the appropriate steps of bourgeois capitalist development first. And when a Russian bourgeoisie failed to fully manifest itself, as Trotsky later sneered, ‘the Mensheviks themselves undertook, with more or less success, to carry out its duties.’ Which is exactly what the CPC now claims to be doing: dutifully building its own version of liberal capitalist modernity, so that afterwards it will have the pleasure of abolishing it. When it’s all done, they can put up monuments to Marx, Axelrod and Martov in Tiananmen Square: these three dead Jews who saw clearly the inevitable path of history. But maybe afterwards, there’ll still be one village left stubbornly clinging to the old ways. Maybe people will be curious enough to visit Nanjiecun, this last relic of capitalism, with its archaic relations of ‘employer’ and ‘employee,’ its exchange of goods for cash, its factories churning out exchange-values, and its statues of Chairman Mao.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

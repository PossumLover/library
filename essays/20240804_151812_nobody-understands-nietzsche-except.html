The fourteen-year-old Nietzsche reader is AJ Soprano upsetting his family by announcing the death of God: a deeply annoying little twerp. They are not sophisticated readers, fourteen-year-olds, and when they come into contact with Nietzsche they all seem to suddenly discover the same thing: the reason none of the other kids like them isn’t that they’re generally weird and uncomfortable to be around, but that they’re actually intrinsically <em>better</em> than everyone else. Teenage Superman, standing above the common herd. When Nietzsche talks about the qualities of the superior man—‘pride, pathos of distance, great responsibility, exuberant spirits, splendid animalism, the instincts of war and of conquest, the deification of passion’—our shy, pustulent little Jimmy somehow sees a perfect description of himself.</p><p>My experience was different, but only because at fourteen I was already hooked on something else. Maybe there are kids who can grow up without some kind of intellectual compensation for their lives, but I wasn’t one of them. I was a big, flabby child, dyspraxically graceless, and permanently undergoing some kind of orthodontic treatment. Little flecks of food got stuck in my braces and I spat them out when I spoke. The school had tried to force me to play football with the other kids during PE, and then accepted defeat; I had implicit permission to hide in the changing rooms and read my book instead. I had kissed two girls, on the lips, no tongue, but both incidents had been during games of spin the bottle at Jewish summer camp, and I was keenly aware that this didn’t really count. Meanwhile, some of the girls I knew, the girls I hopelessly pined after, were having <em>actual sex</em> with grown men in their early twenties. The girls had already been inducted into the secret velvet-fringed world of adult sexuality, and I knew that I had been permanently locked out. I was a child; I would remain a child; a huge hulking spacker in some primary-coloured nursery room, crouched over my tiny, hairless, useless cock. Of course, I knew that these girls had been inducted into the adult world by men screaming obscenities at them out of moving cars. I knew that every time they did the inconceivable act with these sophisticated older lovers they were, legally speaking, being raped. But that wasn’t what haunted me: it was the incontrovertible fact that unlike those cool grown-up paedophiles, I would die a virgin. Also, I suspected all my friends were constantly making plans to hang out without me. I had no actual evidence that this was taking place. But why wouldn’t they? Who could possibly want me to come along? </p><p>But it was all ok, because I’d discovered that sex wasn’t real. In fact, the entire physical world, with its inaccessible bodies and its frightening PE lessons, was an illusion. I’d read <em>Valis</em> by Philip K Dick, which had got me quite deeply into Gnosticism. I printed off several of the Nag Hammadi codices from a website called gnosis.org and read them in bed. I knew that the god of this world, the one my parents chanted to on Friday nights, was actually a lion-headed serpent called Samael, a blind idiot god who created the false world of matter and the flesh. Because the demiurge is blind, his world is utterly broken, which is why there’s so much poverty and injustice, and why I was locked out of all its good bits. But beyond Samael’s false creation there’s a true world, and this is where we really belong. The best part, though, is that we can get there through <em>thought</em>, knowledge, studying, which happened to be the one thing I was really good at. Later, I was delighted to discover that the exact same idea was at the core of a Hindu philosophy called Advaita Vedanta. I composed big diagrams of the precise relation between Pāramārthika and Vyāvahārika, Brahman and Ishvara, Atman and Jiva, with a dotted line running through everything to represent the veil of Māyā. Moksha and gnosis were the same thing. In fact, I started to realise, this idea was everywhere. Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume. Whenever serious people had pondered the nature of the universe, they’d all concluded that the material world is fake, and genuine reality is made of pure thought. I was part of an intellectual confraternity that included Plato and Jesus and the Vedic sages. I was actually intrinsically <em>better</em> than everyone else. I was achieving ecstatic union with God.</p><p>When I picked up <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> at fourteen years old, all I knew about Friedrich Nietzsche was that he was a philosopher, which meant he would naturally be one of <em>my people</em>, who loved thought and learning and escape from the material world. So I started reading. Overcoming humanity, becoming the Overman: fine. I liked transcendence. But then, in the third chapter, I ran into this:</p><p><em>Once Zarathustra too cast his deluded fancy beyond man, like all backworldsmen. Then the world seemed to me the work of a suffering and tortured God. Thus speak I to backworldsmen. It was suffering and impotence—that created all backworlds. And then it wanted to get its head through the ultimate walls—and not its head only—over into the ‘other world.’ But that ‘other world’ is well concealed from man, that dehumanised, inhuman world, which is a celestial nothing; and the bowels of existence do not speak to man, except as man. I teach man a new will: to choose that path which man has followed blindly, and to approve of it—and no longer to slink aside from it, like the sick and perishing! The sick and perishing—it was they who despised the body and the earth, and invented the heavenly world; but even those sweet and sad poisons they borrowed from the body and the earth! They sought escape from their misery, and the stars were too remote for them. Then they sighed: ‘Oh if only there were heavenly paths by which to steal into another existence and into happiness!’ Beyond the sphere of their body and this earth they now fancied themselves transported, these ungrateful ones. But to what did they owe the convulsion and rapture of their transport? To their body and this earth.</em></p><p>Well, I thought, <em>fuck</em>. I could feel the finger of this Friedrich Nietzsche, pointing through three centuries to jab me directly in the chest. He had my number. I thought I was special, I thought I was different from everyone else, but he had sussed me out without having even met me. His language was frilly and silly, but underneath all those <em>verily</em>s and <em>unto</em>s and non-standard word orders there was something cold, arctically cold, clear and crystalline. Here was a blue sky and an icy wind to clear out all the mystical gunk that had accumulated in my brain.</p><p>I kept reading, in something like terror. And then, finally, I arrived at the eighteenth chapter, when Zarathustra meets the old woman, and delivers some little lessons about her sex. ‘Everything about woman is a riddle, and everything about woman has one solution: it is called pregnancy… Woman has to obey and find a depth for her surface. Woman’s nature is surface, a changeable, stormy film upon shallow waters.’ In thanks, the old woman offers a lesson of her own. ‘Are you visiting women? Do not forget your whip!’ And suddenly, everything was alright again. I didn’t need to be afraid of this man who spoke in the voice of a frozen wind, and I didn’t need to listen to anything he had to say about me or my weakness, because this man was the worst thing it’s possible to be. He was a <em>misogynist</em>. </p><p>In fact, Nietzsche was more than just a misogynist. He was also against democracy, the working classes, peace, kindness, and humanity itself, and while he wasn’t exactly a racist he still found time to bemoan the abolition of slavery. He was every shade of reactionary going; at root, he hated the principle of equality. Equality meant mediocrity, degeneration, the Last Man; it meant reducing everyone to the state of those placid fish that eat the algae off aquarium walls. Against the dysgenic tide of liberalism and socialism, he believed that a man worthy of life ‘must be <em>bred</em>.’ He dreamed of a ‘party of life-advocates, which will undertake the greatest of all tasks, the ruthless extermination of all degenerate and parasitical elements.’ In the end, that party arrived, which is why so many branches in my extended family tree are cut off at the exact same point. But the bit that really upset me was the misogyny. I could entertain, in the abstract, a return to the body and this earth, but the misogyny reminded me that unlike the world of spirit and thought, the world of the body is split by the enormous scar of sexual difference. Returning meant <em>reducing women to their bodies</em>. This was what the cool paedophiles were already doing. But I also knew that despite all my Gnostic pretensions, I—sneaking onto the family computer under cover of night to download something called 3_girl_soapy_car_wash.jpg on LimeWire, print it out, stare hard at those hard round tits and those plastic American smiles and then, once it was done, tear up the picture and flush the pieces down the toilet before my parents came home—was guilty too. </p><p>Nietzsche said that every great philosophy is ‘the personal confession of its author, a kind of unintended and unwitting memoir.’ But I think that goes for readers as well. Nietzsche is a mirror. Tell me what you think of Nietzsche, and I’ll tell you who you are. </p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><div><hr></div><p>In 1987, Allan Bloom wrote that despite Nietzsche’s obvious reactionary sympathies, ‘today virtually every Nietzschean is a leftist.’ That might have been true in the 1980s, but it’s not true any more. For a while, generations of good antifascist thinkers managed to find something worthwhile in his Arctic-blue ravings: Adorno liked the transvaluation of values, the ‘intransigent critique of practical reason,’ and the aphoristic style; Foucault took a daring leap into a world without origins; Deleuze borrowed the ontology of becoming; Derrida loved the affirmation. Derrida’s Nietzsche is my favourite; he consists of essentially a single word, which is ‘yes.’ Bloom thought this appropriation by the left marked ‘the failure of Nietzsche’s war against equality,’ but in a way, it was the fulfilment of everything Nietzsche himself wanted. From <em>The Gay Science</em>: ‘I do not want to wage war against ugliness. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse the accusers. Some day I want only to be a Yes-sayer!’ This is what I was <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/i-love-america-and-the-world">trying to channel</a> after the Donald Trump shooting. But the fact remains that despite Derrida’s intervention, the actual Nietzsche did say a lot of words other than ‘yes,’ and some of them were ‘the,’ ‘weak,’ ‘must,’ ‘be,’ and ‘exterminated.’ We acted as if we could simply cut out all the nasty stuff, the glorification of rank and cruelty and power for its own sake, surgically remove it like a tumour, leaving only healthy tissue. Replace the will to power with the critique of power. We didn’t consider whether someone might come along and pick up our scraps. </p><p>When a Nietzschean right did start re-emerging around 2016, there were a lot of very earnest essays about how badly they’d misinterpreted Nietzsche—who was, after all, just a cuddly philosopher of continual ontological flux, who thought German nationalism was petty and parochial, and who actually greatly admired the Jews. Even I got in on it. ‘You can always tell a bad reading of Nietzsche,’ I said, ‘because its principle of distinction is strength rather than size.’ </p><p>At this point I’d made my peace with the beast. I’d grown to love his surging prose and his cold cold clarity; I loved the sense of vastness, the world without limits; I shared his disdain for everything petty and small. But when Nietzsche started talking about the <em>strong</em> and the <em>weak</em>, or master and slave morality, it left me with a very familiar sense of guilty recognition. Like the backworldsmen all over: the same sense of a finger jabbing me in the chest. I could see how the online left worked, its habit of tearing down anyone who was too weird or distinctive. You weren’t allowed to have too much confidence either; it might make other people feel bad. If you had ever been happy in your life, you were expected to be silently ashamed of it. The only way you could stand up for yourself was by claiming to be a weak and suffering victim, so everyone constantly accused everyone else of having victimised them. The whole thing was packed with cruelty and resentment, and Nietzsche had accurately diagnosed this too—but his remedy was genuinely monstrous. So I decided that paying any attention to any of this made you a <em>bad Nietzschean</em>. I decided that the right-wing Nietzscheans, who did pay attention to it, were like the fourteen-year-old Nietzscheans: they were unsophisticated, they’d missed the point.</p><p>And it’s true that the new Nietzschean right are not particularly sophisticated. They’re not interested in anti-foundationalism or eternal return. All they’ve taken from Nietzsche is a single principle, which is <em>inequality</em>: the notion that all lives do not have the same value. Instead, some people are masters and some are slaves; the masters must explore their strength however they see fit, and what happens to the slaves is nobody’s fault but their own. On the discursive level, this means a lot of cosmic imagery, steppe raiders, burning cities, bodybuilding, the desert, Atlantis, outright racism, the grandeur and terror of a white-hot sun. In more practical <em>political</em> terms, it boils down to cutting taxes and slashing the welfare state so people with more economically useful skills can fully realise their value through the mechanism of the free market. Thrilling, radical stuff. But while these are all very small men, their amputated ideology only exists because the left had already spent four decades exhibiting its own half-Nietzsche in formaldehyde. Now the right have an equal and opposite answer to all those earnest 2016 thinkpieces about how badly misunderstood Nietzsche has been, and it looks like this:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc54d22b-20b1-421d-b4d5-4e002833f939_529x580.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc54d22b-20b1-421d-b4d5-4e002833f939_529x580.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc54d22b-20b1-421d-b4d5-4e002833f939_529x580.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc54d22b-20b1-421d-b4d5-4e002833f939_529x580.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc54d22b-20b1-421d-b4d5-4e002833f939_529x580.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc54d22b-20b1-421d-b4d5-4e002833f939_529x580.webp" width="529" height="580" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cc54d22b-20b1-421d-b4d5-4e002833f939_529x580.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:580,&quot;width&quot;:529,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:59722,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc54d22b-20b1-421d-b4d5-4e002833f939_529x580.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc54d22b-20b1-421d-b4d5-4e002833f939_529x580.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc54d22b-20b1-421d-b4d5-4e002833f939_529x580.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc54d22b-20b1-421d-b4d5-4e002833f939_529x580.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>There aren’t so many of those thinkpieces any more. On the left, the growing consensus is that maybe we were wrong to be messing around with the Antichrist to begin with. Maybe there’s no rational kernel to extract, maybe his reactionary politics seep into everything. Let the right have him. Meanwhile, the most <a href="https://benthams.substack.com/p/shut-up-about-slave-morality">recent wave</a> of polemics against Nietzscheanism have come from liberal utilitarians, who have finally discovered the existence of evil. The kind of master morality now popular on the extremely online right—which says that you shouldn’t care about the suffering of others, in fact you should spit on them—is evil. It’s the kind of outright, cartoonish evil you’re only supposed to encounter in comic books and films. ‘When people object to slave morality,’ one writes, ‘they are just objecting to morality. They are objecting to the notion that you should care about others and doing the right thing.’ (Of course, comic books and films actually tend to represent <em>two </em>forms of evil. There’s the Nietzschean evil that kills and destroys simply because it can. But there’s also the evil that kills and destroys because it has rationally calculated that doing so will prevent even more death and destruction in the future. Even if its calculation is correct, this is still considered to be evil. Tell me what you think of Nietzsche, and I’ll tell you who you are.) It got to the point that Scott Alexander—who’s come a long way—ended up mounting a <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/matt-yglesias-considered-as-the-nietzschean">partial defence</a> of master morality, insofar as it encourages people to be maybe slightly more active and interesting than a corpse. But what we end up with is another domesticated, cuddly Nietzsche, who just wants to make a better and more interesting world for everyone, and we’ve seen how that ends up. You can’t just hygienically section off the luminous evil at the heart of Nietzsche’s philosophy; you have to face it head on.</p><p>Nietzsche wrote that good is ‘whatever augments the feeling of power,’ and evil is ‘whatever springs from weakness,’ and that the first principle of his charity was that ‘the weak and the botched shall perish, and one should help them to it.’ But Nietzsche also wrote that every great philosophy is ‘a kind of unintended and unwitting memoir.’ It seems significant, then, that Nietzsche the man was sickly and shy and weak. </p><div><hr></div><p>He was not always weak. The young Nietzsche was smart and energetic, restless. He studied theology with the idea of becoming a minister like his father, but then he lost his faith. So he studied philology instead, but books were too easily conquered to interest him, so he joined the Prussian artillery instead. He wrote in a letter to his friend Karl von Gersdorff: ‘My horse is a very fine animal, and I am supposed to have some talent for riding. When I and my steed gallop round the large parade ground, I feel very contented with my lot.’ Six months later, he tried to spring elegantly into the saddle but somehow fucked up the procedure so badly that he tore the muscles down his chest. ‘I quietly went on riding, and endured the increasing pain for a day and a half. On the evening of the second day, however, I had two fainting fits, and on the third day I lay as if nailed to my bed, suffering the most terrible agony.’ No more games with horses and cannon for young Fritz: back to the quiet, cloistered world of thought. </p><p>He recovered enough to rejoin the Prussian military in time for the 1870 war with France, but not as an artilleryman: as a nurse. ‘I am glad,’ he wrote to his mother, ‘to have been able to help a little in the midst of all the incredible misery.’ But in the process, he contracted dysentery and diphtheria; when those cleared up he started experiencing the headaches and nausea that would recur for the rest of his life. In agony he decamped for Italy, where the milder winters were supposed to salve his almost constant pain. They did not. Somewhere along the line, he also picked up syphilis. Almost certainly from a brothel, since Nietzsche, who hid his face behind an enormous bushy moustache, never had any lovers. He proposed three times to Lou Andreas-Salomé, and was rejected three times, but she did sleep with his friend Paul Rée, and allowed Nietzsche to third-wheel in their travels around Switzerland. There’s a photo of the three of them: Rée and Nietzsche pull a cart, in which Salomé, smiling, brandishes a whip. Later, Salomé ended up having affairs with Rainer Maria Rilke and her pick of the handsome young men of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. Her conquests were rumoured to include Freud himself. Nietzsche ended up addicted to opium. </p><p>This man spent his life in continual physical decay, rotting from the inside out. First his bowels, then his brain. Phlegm filled his lungs. He found sleep almost impossible. In the end he was sent away to an asylum; the story goes that he witnessed a horse being whipped in the street, and he threw his arms around the animal’s neck, weeping. After that, he vanished; all he produced were a few crazy letters to the crowned heads of Europe. ‘I'd much rather have been a Basel professor than God; but I didn't dare be selfish enough to forgo the creation of the world.’ But right up until the day they sent him away, this shivering bag of mucus and bones kept on insisting that right belonged only to people like himself, with a ‘superabundance of strength,’ and when he trampled over the weak and the sickly that was the only true justice there will ever be.</p><p>This is what’s so difficult about Nietzsche: he could turn his devastating hyperborean insight on absolutely any subject except himself. He simply did not understand himself; he was not in on his own joke. But he was also his own favourite topic. Page after page of Nietzsche’s massively autistic lack of self-awareness. As if we can’t see, as if it isn’t obvious to everyone else what he really is. ‘At heart I am a warrior. Attacking belongs to my instincts.’ Sure. ‘Women all like me, save, of course, the abortions among them, the emancipated ones, those who lack the wherewithal to have children. Thank goodness I am not willing to let myself be torn to pieces! The perfect woman tears you to pieces when she loves you.’ Absolutely. ‘I am a pure Polish nobleman, not mixed with a drop of bad blood, least of all German blood.’ He was not, in fact, descended from Polish nobility, but that didn’t stop him wearing a signet ring with the arms of the Wierzbowczyk szlachta. And then there’s the music. ‘There has never been a philosopher,’ he writes, ‘who has been in his essence a musician to such an extent as I am.’ Which is true, if we’re just talking about his prose, but Nietzsche decided his true calling was to be the world’s greatest composer to boot. You can <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kauwA32Rps6sRkfT1T27IHUyydhgllVNo&amp;si=Wa-L0yERWwUXBHjZ">listen to some of his music online</a>—but before you do, imagine for a moment what Nietzsche’s music might sound like. <em>Sturm und drang</em>? Big crashing cacophonies? Music for lightning and volcanoes? If that’s what you think, you don’t understand Nietzsche any better than he did. It’s all very careful, very mannered, very Apollonian—that is, <em>utterly lifeless</em>, without any kind of spark or spirit whatsoever. The musical equivalent of Hitler’s prissy watercolours. The story goes that Nietzsche sent the sheet music for his own compositions to Richard and Cosima Wagner as a birthday present. (The Wagners were another couple that condescended to hang out with Nietzsche: they both knew that the great scorner of women was desperately in love with Cosima, but somehow that didn’t seem to threaten them.) Midway through the performance of his gift, Wagner had to excuse himself; he was found in another room, on the floor, laughing hysterically.</p><p>I don’t know about you, but I find all this very <em>interesting</em>. The biographical details add a bit of depth and complexity to Nietzsche’s somewhat monotonous supremacism. But it’s a real problem for the Nietzschean right. How do they deal with it? Well, mostly, they don’t. They just ignore. This is the strategy employed by Costin Alamariu, aka Bronze Age Pervert, author of the most stunningly pointless book ever written. <em>Bronze Age Mindset</em> is literally just a tribute act to Nietzsche, and like all tribute acts it’s not a patch on the real thing. So why bother? Well, firstly, unlike Nietzsche’s work Alamariu’s book contains a lot of weird right-wing babytalk and memespeak, which some people must find entertaining, and secondly, its author is not the most diseased man of the nineteenth century, but a rosy-cheeked bodybuilder with a PhD. Now that ironic gap is closed; you can enjoy your ideology of dumb triumphant strength without having to acknowledge the sick, sad man behind the curtain. No more complexity. Everything makes sense again.</p><p>Except—does it really? Spend enough time observing the Nietzschean right and it becomes quickly apparent that these people are <em>not well</em>. They are trapped in a world made entirely out of poison. Seed oils, xenoestrogens, microplastics, BPAs. The life they advocate is one spent in a state of constant neurasthenic frenzy about your health. Get on the Ray Peat diet. Eat raw eggs. Worry, be worried all the time about how the bugmen are trying to destroy your body from the inside out, and for God’s sake don’t fuck anyone unless you want your vital essence to just drain out of your balls and into the sea. You must be a fortress. We’re a long, long way from the joyful affirmation of everything that exists. Maybe there’s a specific wound here. In his youth Alamariu studied political science with all the Straussians at Yale, and Straussians are known to believe in the erotic dimensions of education, in the fine tradition of Plato’s Academy; maybe it was the experience of being a pretty red-cheeked departmental catamite that let the horror in. Or maybe not; maybe those who ignore Nietzsche’s weakness are simply doomed to repeat it. </p><p>But I’m not sure the opposite procedure is much better. In his <em>Introduction to Antiphilosophy</em> Boris Groys writes that ‘when Nietzsche praises victorious life, preaches <em>amor fati</em> and identifies himself with the forces of nature that are bound to destroy him, he simply seeks to divert himself and others from the fact that he himself is sick, poor, weak and unhappy.’ Bertrand Russell dismisses Nietzsche’s philosophy as the ‘power-phantasies of an invalid.’ (As a man who really knew his way around the pussy, Russell is particularly scathing about Nietzsche’s sublimated terror of women. ‘Forget not thy whip—but nine women out of ten would get the whip away from him, and he knew it.’) Nietzsche’s sickness becomes a kind of <em>gotcha</em>, the final defence against his thought. Never mind the freezing storm uprooting everything in its path—it’s just a <em>symptom</em>. But I don’t think Zarathustra is simply a diversion or a distraction or a flimsy mask worn by the shambling creature of Turin. There have been a lot of feeble, lovelorn men pottering about the world in their mild overcoats. Most of them did not write like he did. You can’t ignore the weakness of the man or the strength of his writing. You have to stay with the contradiction. You have to grab them both. </p><p>The obvious answer is one philosophers have a strangely hard time comprehending, but almost every fourteen-year-old who’s picked up a book of Nietzsche’s has instantly recognised. When Nietzsche talks about master morality, he is <em>not talking to the masters</em>; he’s talking to the weak and the botched and to pimply Jimmy: to the slaves. </p><p>According to his myth, master morality is the natural creed of the free, strong, noble peoples of the world. Eventually, though, their victims banded together and decided that strength and nobility were evil, and the best thing to be is harmless and meek, and slave morality was born. Like all great and true myths, this one bears no actual relation to history. There never was a tribe of blond beasts practising an ethos of pure cruelty. It’s master morality that was invented by the weak and the botched—by one particular weak and botched individual, which was Friedrich Nietzsche. Its isn’t to compensate for his weakness. Nietzsche insisted he was strong, but he was always very specific about what his strength was made of. ‘I always instinctively select the proper remedy when my spiritual or bodily health is low; whereas the decadent, as such, invariably chooses those remedies which are bad for him.’ Master morality is a remedy by and for the weak.</p><p>According to the popular caricature, slave morality is about being nice and master morality is about being mean. But that’s not quite it. The overflowing life Nietzsche praises also encompasses ‘kindness and love, the most curative herbs and agents in human intercourse,’ and ‘good nature, friendliness, and courtesy of the heart.’ The real difference is that behind its meekness, slave morality is powered entirely by <em>resentment</em>: the secret, poisonous delight in being weak, being the saintly victim, feasting on the black slime of your own self-regard. According to some Oxford textbook that’s the first result that when you Google the words ‘nietzsche resentment,’ and which I’ll take as representative of the field, ‘Nietzsche is against resentment because it is an emotion of the weak that the strong and powerful do not and cannot feel.’ Not true! He’s very clear that the strong <em>can</em> feel resentment, but for them ‘resentment is a superfluous feeling, a feeling to remain master of, which is almost a proof of riches.’ It’s the other way round; Nietzsche has disdain for the weak because they have been <em>overwhelmed</em> by resentment: </p><p><em>Nothing on earth consumes a man more quickly than the passion of resentment. Mortification, morbid susceptibility, the inability to wreak revenge, the desire and thirst for revenge, the concoction of every sort of poison—this is surely the most injurious manner of reacting which could possibly be conceived by exhausted men. It involves a rapid wasting away of nervous energy, an abnormal increase of detrimental secretions, as, for instance, that of bile into the stomach. To the sick man resentment ought to be more strictly forbidden than anything else—it is </em>his<em> special danger. He knows not how to get rid of anything, how to come to terms with anything, and how to cast anything behind him. Everything wounds him. Resentment born of weakness is not more deleterious to anybody than it is to the weak man himself.</em></p><p>So: Nietzsche might have been weak, but he refused the comforts of resentment. His entire philosophy is a image of what it would look like to really live without those comforts. Instead of festering, everything bursts outwards. Passion, violence, the terrible freedom of the man-shaped wolf. The pleasures of power as an antidote to the much more potent and seductive pleasures of suffering. It’s hyperbolic; of course it’s hyperbolic: he needs something furious enough to burn through the accumulated layers of resentment that have formed around your skin. Everything I love about Nietzsche is part of this project. The ontology of becoming: what would it look like to have a metaphysics that’s completely untouched by resentment? It would look like a world that’s constantly being cast behind itself. The perspectivism: how do you build a non-resentful epistemology? By making it impossible to cling to the tawdry compensations of truth. But the really ugly and monstrous parts of his thought—slavery, murder, wars of mass extermination breaking out across the entire world—they’re part of it too. They might have been a metaphor, but he really did believe in them. Too much of any remedy becomes a poison. </p><p>But if you want to see what master morality really looks like, I can show you. I’ve already given the traditional list of left-wing philosophers who started messing around with Nietzsche: Adorno, Foucault, Deleuze, Derrida. They’re not so trendy any more, but you could also mention Sartre and Camus. Weirdly, the one name that gets left out is Frantz Fanon—but the first and last thinker he mentions in <em>Black Skin, White Masks</em> is Friedrich Nietzsche. In between, he proceeds in a basically Hegelian mode, unfolding the long dialectic between self and other and all their mirrored repetitions across the enslaved and colonised world, but by the end of the book he’s stuck. He has a terrible vision. ‘On the field of battle, its four corners marked by the scores of Negroes hanged by their testicles, a monument is slowly being built that promises to be majestic. And, at the top of this monument, I can already see a white man and a black man <em>hand in hand</em>.’ Everything still takes place in the eyes of the other; the abolition of slavery and the discourse of racial equality and the furious embrace of blackness—‘Blood! Blood! All our blood stirred by the male heart of the sun!’—are all just new ways of preventing any actual human reciprocity. Deadlock. Impasse. But as Fanon promised right at the beginning, ‘there is a zone of nonbeing, an extraordinarily sterile and arid region, an utterly naked declivity where an authentic upheaval can be born.’ In the concluding chapter, we get that upheaval. The epigraph is from Marx, and some of the concepts too, but it’s thrumming with pure Nietzsche. Suddenly Fanon breaks out of the dialectic, out of resentment, out of race altogether. In one move, he casts off an entire three-hundred-year history of victimhood.</p><p><em>I as a man of colour do not have the right to hope that in the white man there will be a crystallization of guilt toward the past of my race.</em></p><p><em>I as a man of colour do not have the right to seek ways of stamping down the pride of my former master.</em></p><p><em>I have neither the right nor the duty to claim reparation for the domestication of my ancestors.</em></p><p><em>In the world through which I travel, I am endlessly creating myself.</em></p><p><em>I am a part of Being to the degree that I go beyond it.</em></p><p><em>The body of history does not determine a single one of my actions. I am my own foundation.</em></p><p><em>I, the man of colour, want only this: That the tool never possess the man. That the enslavement of man by man cease forever. That is, of one by another. That it be possible for me to discover and to love man, wherever he may be.</em></p><p><em>My final prayer: O my body, make of me always a man who questions!</em></p><p>This voice that’s speaking doesn’t quite exist, of course: no more than Zarathustra. When he finished writing, Frantz Fanon was still a black man in a white country, in a world where history still weighs like a nightmare and very few people are free. This is precisely <em>why</em> he understood Nietzsche so much better than any of the pompous reactionaries and fussy leftists of his day, or ours. We’re still a long way from the endlessly self-creating man, and to actually get there is the work of politics. But to set your sights on that goal, you need something else. The weakness and suffering that summons a cold, cold wind. The pitiless light of the sun. </p>

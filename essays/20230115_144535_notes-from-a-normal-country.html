All photos mine</figcaption></figure></div><p>I went to Hebron because of what I’d seen in Florentin. Florentin is a cool part of Tel Aviv. For a good chunk of the twentieth century it was a slum, a semi-industrial tract full of metal workshops and cheap seedy housing. One-room concrete shacks; old men eating alone behind open windows. Flophouses for desperate workers who’d smuggled themselves over from Gaza. Today, it’s another Brooklyn. The artists started moving in by the late 90s, because the rents were cheap and it was close to the beach; now, a six hundred square-foot apartment in Florentin will set you back the best part of a million dollars. Some of the old workshops are still there, but they’re sandwiched between lots of tasteful pop-up galleries and interesting brunch places that do interesting things with eggs. The new residents hang Pride flags from their balconies. They like the neighbourhood for its buzzing arts scene and its lingering sense of gritty authenticity. It feels <em>real</em>. They also like the graffiti that’s been sprayed across every building. That feels real too.

Wolt is a Finnish meal delivery app that seems to have cornered the Israeli market; on a Saturday, when the entire country shuts down for Shabbat, when the trains stop running and all the shops are closed, the only vehicles on the street are Wolt bikes: furiously pedalled by African migrants, delivering food made in ambiguously legal dark kitchens by other African migrants, so the secular types who live in places like Florentin can have their sushi and tacos on the holy day of rest. You may have already encountered OnlyFans, Netflix, capitalism, and the police. All of these things strike me as broadly bad and exploitative, and while I’m not sure spraypainting ‘fuck capitalism’ on the side of a building <em>achieves</em> much, it’s not as if I have any better ideas. But this is a deeply, deeply strange list of things for some anarchist in <em>Israel</em> to be prefixing with the word ‘fuck’—because there’s something missing. No ‘fuck the occupation’? No ‘fuck the settlements’? Not even a ‘fuck apartheid’? It’s less than fifteen miles from Florentin to the West Bank, not much further than the length of Manhattan. Here in Tel Aviv, you can eat the interesting eggs and look at street art. There, less than a week before I arrived in the country, an Army sniper put a bullet through a teenage girl’s head. I don’t think the person who painted this mural <em>supports</em> this. They just don’t think about it very much. It’s not in front of them, which means that when it’s time to write a list of that which must be fucked, the forty-five-year occupation doesn’t seem as immediate an evil as OnlyFans and Netflix and Wolt.</p><p>In other words, this mural was the work of someone who thought they lived in a normal country. And in a way, they were right.</p><p>Liberal Israelis are obsessed with this idea: of being a <em>normal country</em>, like Denmark, maybe, or New Zealand. A Jewish state, but not a <em>Jew among states</em>, some special case sequestered in its own private ghetto and subject to different rules. A normal country is at peace with its neighbours and itself. In a normal country, you can hang out on the beach and eat falafel and spraypaint angry messages about veganism in a gentrifying downtown neighbourhood. In a normal country, political disputes are about normal things: the tax rate, the health system, the trains. It’s there in the stuff you hear from Israel’s advocates abroad. Why are you <em>singling out</em> this country, when you should be criticising China or Iran instead? How would you expect <em>any other country</em> to respond to Hamas and its rockets? Because that’s what they want to be. Not a messianic hope. Not a light unto the nations. Not a sign of the End Times. Just a normal country, like anywhere else.</p><p>And this is very nearly what they are. Israel is a normal country. Like most normal countries, it gained independence from Britain in the middle of the last century. In its first months, Israel nearly experienced a civil war between rival Zionist militia, which would have been normal too. Look at Ireland. Look at South Sudan. Like most normal countries, it was initially supported by the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc states, before becoming an eager American puppet in the Cold War and beyond. Like most normal countries, especially in the Middle East, it spent a few decades toying with a kind of non-Marxist socialism, before making sweeping capitalist reforms in the 1970s and 80s, and then increasingly coming under the sway of hardline religious movements. Like most normal countries, its once-hegemonic left is now almost entirely extinct. Like most normal countries, over the last few decades its politics have been dominated by the ambitions of one individual, a charismatic right-wing strongman, thuggish and corrupt, increasingly desperate, possibly criminal, utterly despised by the liberal classes, but whom the electorate will simply not stop voting back into office.</p><p>This normal country seems to be lurching towards a new and very normal kind of government: democratic, in a way, but democratic with insistently <em>bad vibes</em>. Netanyahu’s new administration wants to let the Knesset override any Supreme Court decision with a simple majority—and, well, the Knesset is elected, while the Supreme Court is not. They want to let doctors refuse to treat gay patients, or unmarried women—and in a democratic society, should people really be <em>forced</em> to violate their religious beliefs? They want school curriculums to adhere to a narrow, sectarian concept of national and Jewish identity—and so, it seems, do plenty of the voters. There is still an opposition, but it’s an incoherent mush of religious parties, right-wing secularists, liberal centrists, and Islamists. Many of its members don’t even oppose any of this stuff; they just have a strong personal dislike of Netanyahu. And some of the new coalition’s smaller partners go further. The Noam party wants to institute the Chief Rabbinate of Israel as a ‘fourth branch of government.’ The Religious Zionism party wants to introduce Torah study as an alternate form of national service. The United Torah Judaism party wants Israel to devote state funds to <em>genizah</em>, the collection and preservation of any scraps of paper that might contain the name of God. They want sex-segregated beaches. They want the entire country to stop producing electricity on Shabbat. </p><p>In most countries, coalition agreements do not include suggestions that the entire national grid should shut down one day a week. This is unusual; this is why the people of Florentin are currently massing on bridges and demanding a return to normal. But it’s also part of a more general, more widespread transformation of the state. Liberals once saw the state as a neutral, secular institution for the administration for society as a whole. Not any more. Everyone now knows that the state is an <em>instrument</em>, a pointy stick which one group of grudgeful weirdos can use to poke at another, and democracy is when the biggest group of weirdos gets to hold the stick. Usually it’s not even about bringing a desired form of society into being; instead, the point is simply to remind your political enemies that <em>you’ve got the stick</em>. This may have something to do with what Dylan Riley and Robert Brenner have recently called ‘political capitalism’: as secular stagnation sets in, political parties can no longer offer competing programmes for growth. Instead, they begin to function as sectional patronage networks. They offer their preferred segments of the capitalist class better rates of return in a low-growth environment, through ‘an escalating series of tax breaks, the privatisation of public assets at bargain-basement prices, quantitative easing plus ultra-low interest rates—and, crucially, massive state spending aimed directly at private industry.’ This is not a hospitable environment for any kind of a left. And so you end up here. A weekly darkness over the cities; ICU units on the fritz; uniformed officials sweeping the gutters for the Tetragrammaton. Just a bigger, dumber version of what’s happening everywhere else. This too is normal. Israel—which was always already partial and sectional—simply got there first.</p><p>Outside Israel, coverage tends to focus on what this new government might mean for the Palestinians. Even for the most committed Zionists in the diaspora, Israel means the opposite of Palestine. But <em>within</em> Israel, the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank are simply <em>not a political object</em>. All the major parties agree; the occupation will continue indefinitely. Why bother even talking about it? It hardly matters now; Israel hasn’t really depended on Palestinian labour since 1992, and a big chunk of Palestinian capital ends up being invested in Palestine’s only real growth industry, which is the construction of Jewish settlements. (This fact often surprises people. It shouldn’t. Palestinian capitalists might be Palestinian, but capital is still just capital, the same blind self-replicating protoplasm, everywhere in the world.) Israel’s political turmoil is the crisis of a scotomised society, turned in on itself, rotting in the closedness of itself. </p><p>Only echoes survive. I found myself thinking a lot about the last line of that graffitied manifesto. ‘Go VEGAN<em>.</em>’ So many liberal Israelis have started veering heavily into their veganism. They have the sense that something terrible is happening, that their ordinary consumer lives are structured by a great hidden cruelty, invisible behind concrete walls, unspoken, unacknowledged, something that seems to very faintly mirror the darkest episodes in recent Jewish history. Something is giving them the guilt. And so they decide that it’s the <em>animals</em>. All those harmless cows and sheep, funnelled into the slaughterhouse to meet the shochet’s knife.</p><p>But the occupation is still there. Things are not normal. These are some stories from my holidays.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><div><hr></div><p>This was not my first time in Israel. My first time in Israel was also my birth: gasping and crying in a hospital in Jerusalem. I might not speak the language, and I might not have joined the Army, but I am, in the strict legal sense, Israeli. The reason I don’t speak Hebrew or know how to handle a Galil is that four months after I was born, Iraq started firing Scud missiles at Tel Aviv. Every time the sirens sounded, everyone in the city had to huddle in the middle of their homes or a public shelter with their gas masks on until they heard the all-clear. More Israelis died from incorrectly wearing the gas masks than from the actual missiles, but it was enough: my parents decided to take me back to London, which was only being bombed by the IRA. I will always feel a strange gratitude to Saddam Hussein.</p><p>My family still brought me to Israel quite a few times as a child, even at the height of the Second Intifada. We had relatives there; still do. Once, during one of those trips, I heard a very loud crack ringing out over Tel Aviv from my uncle’s balcony. A few streets away, someone had pressed a trigger and blown his own body apart, shredded it to bits with ball bearings and rusty screws. A dozen or so people standing next to him at a bus station died. The people standing further away only had to live with the agony of hundreds of small pieces of metal piercing their bodies at high speed. My uncle had lived in Israel for thirty years and never once heard a bomb go off until then. These things always happen somewhere else, until they happen here. In response, Israeli helicopter gunships fired on a refugee camp in the West Bank. It was the last night of our family holiday to the Holy Land; we heard about the IDF’s swift response from Army Radio as the cab took us to the airport. A nice end to our week in the sunshine.</p><p>Back then, the conflict was everywhere. You couldn’t walk into a shopping centre without being rigorously inspected by a security guard with a terrifying glare and a gun. <em>He</em> was thinking about the occupation and the Palestinians; he was thinking about them constantly. Every new face that presented itself to him might be one of <em>theirs</em>, the enemy’s. Over the course of the Second Intifada, 719 Israeli civilians were killed in attacks like that one. None of them achieved anything. The occupation did not end. I’m not sure that the bombers even imagined that they <em>could</em> achieve anything with their attacks; dying and killing might have just seemed like the least undignified thing to do. Or maybe the point was just to make sure that Israelis knew they existed, to end the agony of your enemies riding buses and eating pizza while you are stateless and dispossessed. </p><p>A few of those security guards are still around. When you enter a train station in Tel Aviv, they’ll put your baggage through an X-ray machine to make sure you’re not carrying guns or bombs. The guard sitting by the side of the machine had a gun on his hip, but he wasn’t even looking at the screen. He was playing Candy Crush on his phone. There was another security guard outside the Azrieli Mall. He said something in Hebrew to me and my girlfriend as we approached, which we didn’t understand. There was a kid leaning against the wall next to him, maybe fourteen years old; his brother, I assumed. ‘He’s saying to open your bags,’ the kid said. I dutifully slung the backpack off my back and opened it in front of the kid. ‘No,’ said the guard. ‘Show to me, not him.’ And then, with a touch of real bitterness: ‘He is nothing.’</p><div><hr></div><p>Tel Aviv weirds me out: the ordinariness of it. At home, there are adverts for Tel Aviv plastered over the buses and in the tunnels on the Tube. Sunny beaches! Nightlife! Fun! A buzzing cosmopolitan city on the Mediterranean, just like Palermo or Barcelona. It looks ordinary. But in Israel, ordinary things have different meanings. </p><p>Jaffa—the old Arab port town that was here first, and which has now been swallowed on all sides by the Jewish city that was once its suburb—is full of expensive little boutiques. It’s nice to walk around there. You don’t hear much Arabic on the streets. Ordinary gentrification, the same as anywhere else. About a decade ago, leftists used to be constantly writing essays about how gentrification is actually a form of colonialism; a few years later, embarrassed, they stopped. But <em>this</em> gentrification began in 1948, when the Lehi detonated a truck bomb outside the local government office, splattering a group of children eating at a charity kitchen, and when the Irgun fired mortars into the city from its suburbs, and when 55,000 residents fled in terror to the refugee camps in the West Bank, where some of them still live. </p><p>Not far from Tel Aviv’s central bus station, I found that someone had left an impotant message behind some dumpsters. On the left, they’d drawn a triangle with an eye in it. On the right, a Star of David. This is the kind of thing you see in a lot of places, and if this conjunction had appeared in almost any other city on the planet, its message would have been obvious: the government is secretly controlled by Jews. The Jews are running everything, behind the scenes, for their own private Jewish interests, which are not the same as the interests of everyone else. In any other country, this would be a false and (more importantly) tedious antisemitic conspiracy theory. In Israel, ‘Jews run the government’ is not a conspiracy theory. It is <em>the entire overt purpose of the state</em>.

In Tel Aviv, I constantly feel somehow <em>exposed</em>, and exposed in precisely the one way they always told me I wouldn’t. I feel exposed <em>as a Jew</em>. </p><p>At home in Britain, my Judaism is not particularly important. It only comes up if I choose to bring it up—and even if I bring it up <em>constantly</em>, the choice is still mine. In Israel, my Judaism is not private. I am here for the same reason everyone else is here; we all have this thing in common, and everyone knows it. There’s an apocryphal line attributed to David Ben Gurion, that ‘Israel will be a normal country when it has Jewish prostitutes and Jewish thieves being arrested by Jewish policemen.’ There’s that phrase again: a normal country. They did it. The fat man swearing out the window of his enormous truck as he tries to drive it down an obviously too-narrow alley—he’s a Jew. The homeless person, sprawled out on the street, blocking his path, is also a Jew. This dogshit was left on the street by careless Jewish pet owners for other Jews to step in. Sometimes American breakfast cereal brands will put out a special edition: there’s been a mistake at the factory, and instead of your usual jumble of grains and additives this pack contains nothing but <em>marshmallows</em>, which you’re supposed to eat in a bowl with milk. This is the Zionist dream. <em>OOPS! Just Jews! </em>The entire country is <em>about</em> my being a Jew. It feels like a finger jabbing itself directly in my face. <em>JEW! We found another one! Look! It’s a Jew!</em></p><p>It doesn’t help much that this finger is, notionally, a friendly, also-Jewish finger. It doesn’t want to hurt me. It only says: what are you doing, as a Jew, as an Israeli citizen, a sabra no less, still moping about in the diaspora? You should come here. You should ditch the shiksa girlfriend and marry a nice Israeli girl called Yael. She’s got long tanned legs and she knows how to fire a gun. Have lots of children with her. Don’t you know there’s a demographic war on? We need people like you to outbreed the Arabs. Like you, Jew: you.</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd270bc72-042d-48bc-8eb2-343b9c05c410_750x561.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd270bc72-042d-48bc-8eb2-343b9c05c410_750x561.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd270bc72-042d-48bc-8eb2-343b9c05c410_750x561.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd270bc72-042d-48bc-8eb2-343b9c05c410_750x561.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd270bc72-042d-48bc-8eb2-343b9c05c410_750x561.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd270bc72-042d-48bc-8eb2-343b9c05c410_750x561.jpeg" width="750" height="561" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d270bc72-042d-48bc-8eb2-343b9c05c410_750x561.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:561,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:553766,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd270bc72-042d-48bc-8eb2-343b9c05c410_750x561.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd270bc72-042d-48bc-8eb2-343b9c05c410_750x561.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd270bc72-042d-48bc-8eb2-343b9c05c410_750x561.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd270bc72-042d-48bc-8eb2-343b9c05c410_750x561.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Acre is one of Israel’s mixed cities. The old city, its warren of crooked streets and tunnels, is mostly Palestinian. Its mosque is supposed to house a lock of the prophet Mohammed’s hair. The new city, with its concrete housing blocks on a strict grid, is almost entirely Jewish. When I first visited at the end of 2020, I was struck by how well everyone seemed to be getting along. I am a Jew who lives in a mostly Muslim patch of London, and this didn’t seem too different from that. Jewish customers tucking into their bean paste at Humus Said. Arabs playing Israeli pop out their car stereos. But a few months later, in May 2021, as Israeli cops attacked worshippers at the al-Aqsa Mosque and Israeli jets bombarded Gaza, the city broke out in massive intercommunal violence. Shows how much I know.</p><p>There were riots in all the mixed cities. Jewish and Palestinian mobs throwing bricks and stones, torching buildings, attacking anyone they heard speak the wrong language. Gunfights between groups of young men and the state authorities. A minor civil war, entirely within Israel’s 1948 borders, and between its citizens. Something broke in Israeli society in those days. Harder to trot out the old line: if Israel is an apartheid state, then what about its millions of Arab citizens, who have the vote, who have their own parties in the Knesset, who have the exact same rights afforded to every Jew? Which was always only symbolic, when you compare the poverty and unemployment rates between Jews and Arabs, but by 2021 even the symbols had changed. According to the 2018 nation-state law, only the Jewish people have the right to self-determination in the land of Israel. The right to self-determination is a strange one. Unlike the right to free speech or the right to a fair trial, it doesn’t really protect you, as a normal living creature that will one day die, from any particular state abuses. Do I have the right to self-determination at home in London? I don’t think so. I’m not really sure what that would look like. It’s a right enjoyed by <em>groups</em>, and the people who choose to identify with them: the right to maintain a certain illusion about the repressive state apparatus; the right to nurture a fantasy in which it somehow belongs to <em>you</em>. The state of Israel was formally instructing its Palestinian citizens to cast off all such fantasies. The law was the first part of this process. The riots were the second.</p><p>One of the buildings burned in Acre was Uri Buri, named as one of TripAdvisor’s 25 best restaurants in the world. Uri Buri was a Jewish establishment in the Palestinian old town, but half of the employees were Arab. The owner, Uri Jeremias, might be the last Israeli Zionist who still really believes in coexistence, in a Jewish state with Palestinians as fully equal citizens. He talked about the experience with the <em>New York Times</em>. ‘I was targeted as a Jew by radicalised thugs,’ he said. ‘But many more Arabs came to help me put out the fires than came to burn my places down.’ Uri Buri has since been rebuilt. We had dinner there. Salmon sashimi with wasabi sorbet. Octopus with arak. The dishes sound nice just to say. The old city was quiet. In the courtyard of the mosque with the lock of Mohammed’s hair, a few charming old men fed the cats that wandered freely around the gardens, then started hosing them down. I wasn’t sure why. But everything seemed fine. Everyone seemed to be getting along. </p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F385efde6-86b1-4f98-8847-f591f4b58ab5_750x560.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F385efde6-86b1-4f98-8847-f591f4b58ab5_750x560.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F385efde6-86b1-4f98-8847-f591f4b58ab5_750x560.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F385efde6-86b1-4f98-8847-f591f4b58ab5_750x560.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F385efde6-86b1-4f98-8847-f591f4b58ab5_750x560.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F385efde6-86b1-4f98-8847-f591f4b58ab5_750x560.jpeg" width="750" height="560" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/385efde6-86b1-4f98-8847-f591f4b58ab5_750x560.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:560,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:377671,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F385efde6-86b1-4f98-8847-f591f4b58ab5_750x560.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F385efde6-86b1-4f98-8847-f591f4b58ab5_750x560.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F385efde6-86b1-4f98-8847-f591f4b58ab5_750x560.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F385efde6-86b1-4f98-8847-f591f4b58ab5_750x560.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Nazareth is the largest Arab city in Israel proper. It doesn’t look like the Jewish cities; it looks like the Middle East. The pavements here are not quite paved, and some of the buildings are not quite built. Raw concrete with iron rebar poking out the roof. Sprawling levantine chaos, traffic incessant, honking, motionless. At the centre of it all, there’s the Basilica of the Annunciation, an enormous 1960s concrete tower built with Vatican money to mark the spot where the archangel Gabriel told Mary that she would bear the son of God. When you go in, you descend into the bowels of the church to see the remains of a Byzantine-era shrine, which was, by tradition, built within Mary’s childhood home. (Another tradition holds that after the fall of the Crusader kingdoms, Mary’s home was actually airlifted by angels to the town of Loreto in Italy.) Nearby is St Joseph’s Church, another twentieth-century building—but when you walk down into the basement there are some pits and cellars that are supposed to be the remains of Joseph’s carpentry workshop. This is what Christians do. They come upon the ruins of an old building in an old city, destroyed and rebuilt a dozen times in the last few centuries, and decide that <em>this</em> is where Joseph and Mary, of all the people who ever inhabited this place, must have lived. The important things are the ones that survive. But Joseph and Mary were ordinary, unimportant people, who did not matter in their own day, whose homes were not preserved; the kind of people who show up as numbers in the news.</p><p>Around the back of the basilica there’s a restaurant called Alreda, which interested us because they let you smoke cigarettes inside. According to the reviews on Google, it was also a <em>racist</em> restaurant. The owner had, apparently, forbidden the staff from talking to customers in Hebew; they could only use Arabic or English. Some comments:</p><blockquote><p>felt a rather racist vibe towards jewish people there. felt really unwelcome and like they were doing me a favor just servicing me.</p><p>the formal language of the state of Israel is forbidden in a well known restaurant. imagine yourself people can do these kind of things in your country. hoping the owner will realize he needs to change his ways.</p><p>Restaurant should not be a political place. You should serve high quality food and excellent service. When you deny your staff to speak Hebrew, the official language in Israel, you are giving BAD service.</p><p>The right of freedom is not one of there priorities.</p><p>Openly racists with the worst service I have ever seen. I am sure they do nefarious things to the food in the kitchen as well. Don’t go to this place. If you don’t want to vomit and get sick.

On Christmas Eve, the pilgrims descend on Bethlehem, but I can’t go. I am an Israeli citizen, and Bethlehem is in Area A, the 18% of the West Bank that’s (notionally) under the full control of the Palestinian Authority. Israeli forbids its citizens from setting foot in Area A, supposedly for our safety. It’s part of the general policy of <em>hafrada</em>: separation; apartness. Non-Israeli Jews, and other tourists like my shiksa girlfriend, are free to cross the checkpoints at will. The Palestinians who live in Area A are not. We asked a few Israelis how likely it was that I’d be caught and sentenced to some kind of terrible punishment if I tried to cross over. None of them could answer. They’d never tried. </p><p>I do not much like Jerusalem, the holy city in which I was born. It’s all fake; it’s all images. This is another things Christians do. What would <em>you</em> do if you came into possession of the very spot where you believed death was conquered and a new life came to be? I think I would fence off the hill of Golgotha as discreetly as I could, so wild grasses might shiver lonely among the stones. I’d leave the tomb as a dark crevasse, a proper home for mystery. Everything would, as much as possible, look exactly as it did the day Jesus of Nazareth walked out from his grave. But wiser people than me got their hands on the site first, and this is not what they’ve done.</p><p>In the fourth century, the entire hill was razed to build the first Church of the Holy Sepulchre; the scene of the Passion is now enclosed under a dark metal dome. Just inside the doors, by the Stone of Anointing, on which Christ’s body is said to have been purified after his death, a mosaic depicts the event itself, the stricken saviour between rocks and trees, under a golden sky. Those tiles gleam faintly in the murk. Under a grand rotunda stands the Aedicule, a modest little chapel containing the empty space of Jesus’ actual tomb, prised out of the rock that once surrounded it. You reach the site of the Crucifixion itself by climbing a set of steep stone stairs. There, surrounding an altar decked out by the Greek Orthodox Church in frilly silver, fragments of the original rock of Calvary can be seen in glass cases. There are three slots in the stone: in one, a painted image of Jesus is nailed to a wooden cross. We have been postmodern for a very long time.</p><p><em>Everything</em> in Jerusalem is like this. Not an old city, but an age-flavoured urban experience. The new city of West Jerusalem is probably one of the ugliest places in the world. Local bylaws insist that all new buildings must be faced in six inches of Jerusalem stone. Every strip mall and high-rise apartment building looks like it’s imitating the Kotel. As the Israeli architect Eyal Weizman explains:</p><blockquote><p>Like the stare of Medusa, the bylaw has been used by Jerusalem’s planners to petrify all construction in the new neighbourhoods – shopping malls and kindergartens, community centres and synagogues, office buildings, electrical relay stations and sports halls and, above all, housing – into stone. Suburban neighbourhoods placed on remote sites outside the historical boundaries of the city were thus imbued with the city’s overall sacred identity.</p></blockquote><p>Here, sanctity is political. The Jewish settlements that hem in the Palestinian parts of the city are also faced in stone. For these authentically Jerusalemite colonies, inspiration is taken from vernacular Arab architecture, while most of the city’s actual Arab residents live in steadfastly modernist apartment blocks, besieged by a caricature of their own history. Weizman quotes Azmi Bishara, then a Palestinian member of the Knesset, now living in exile in Qatar: ‘Only in Jerusalem could the natural stone that was quarried from these very rocks look as a foreign element within these same mountains.’</p><p>Some of the Old City has survived this self-parodification. The Haram al-Sharif is genuinely beautiful; a garden, a miniature Jannah. Some of the Byzantine and Crusader churches along the Via Dolorosa are beautiful too. But while the Jewish Quarter <em>looks</em> like an ancient tangle of low, golden-stone houses, where rabbis and sages might have quarrelled for three thousand years, it’s actually substantially newer than the council estate in London where I live. The whole district was torn down when Israeli forces captured the Old City in 1967, and rebuilt as a Disneyland version of itself.</p><p>The one thing in the Jewish Quarter that doesn’t pretend to be old is an immense gold-plated menorah, kept under a bulletproof glass dome. This is a replica of the candelabrum used in the Second Temple: more specifically, it’s based on an image from the Arch of Titus in Rome, which shows triumphant legionaries carrying off the Temple goods. (Later, when it was Rome’s turn to be sacked, the treasure was plundered by Alaric and the Visigoths, never to be seen again.) This reconstruction is the work of the Temple Institute, a group of ultra-orthodox Jews who intend to raze the al-Aqsa mosque and rebuild a Jewish Temple on its site. The Institute hope that their menorah will one day be used in that temple—at which point it will suddenly stop being a replica, and turn, magically, into the real thing.</p><div><hr></div><p>Santa Claus lives in the Christian Quarter of Old Jerusalem, near the New Gate, in a house covered with holly and tinsel. There’s a sleigh parked outside, and a sign that says ‘Jesus is the reason for the season.’ On Christmas Eve, locals queue for hours to meet him. His name is Issa Kassissieh, and he is the only fully accredited Santa in the Middle East, a graduate of the Charles W Howard Santa Claus School in Midland, Michigan, USA.</p><p>On either side of Santa’s door, there’s another message, carved into a pair of marble slabs:</p><blockquote><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text">ISSA IS THE NAME
BASKETBALL IS THE GAME
JERUSALEM IS THE FAME
PEACE IS THE AIM</pre></div></blockquote><p>And above, printed on ceramic tiles, an image of the man himself, ‘Jerusalem basketball legend Issa Kassissieh,’ with his precisely sculpted beard, bouncing a ball against the backdrop of the Old City. Issa’s claim isn’t invented: before he gave up the sport to become Santa, he was a prodigy, the star of the Palestinian basketball leagues. Issa started out practicing with a hoop he attached to the medieval walls. He played briefly for Israeli and Greek teams, but couldn’t stand being away from his city. The point wasn’t to become an international superstar, the point was to <em>play basketball</em>. Stardom, of a sort, claimed him. Even now, Palestinian Christians paint his name and his rhyming creed over the walls of Jerusalem.</p><p>He wasn’t born in the city, but in a small town out in the Judean back country. His name in Arabic is that of Jesus. It’s not known which gate he went through when he first came to Jerusalem. It’s not known if, at the moment of Issa Kassissieh’s birth, a shining basketball appeared in the sky.</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff648d3c1-52ac-46d6-986c-dc9c3545f671_750x554.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff648d3c1-52ac-46d6-986c-dc9c3545f671_750x554.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff648d3c1-52ac-46d6-986c-dc9c3545f671_750x554.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff648d3c1-52ac-46d6-986c-dc9c3545f671_750x554.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff648d3c1-52ac-46d6-986c-dc9c3545f671_750x554.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff648d3c1-52ac-46d6-986c-dc9c3545f671_750x554.jpeg" width="750" height="554" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f648d3c1-52ac-46d6-986c-dc9c3545f671_750x554.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:554,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:873623,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff648d3c1-52ac-46d6-986c-dc9c3545f671_750x554.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff648d3c1-52ac-46d6-986c-dc9c3545f671_750x554.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff648d3c1-52ac-46d6-986c-dc9c3545f671_750x554.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff648d3c1-52ac-46d6-986c-dc9c3545f671_750x554.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Then we went to Hebron.</p><p>When God made Adam out of clay, it was the red clay of Hebron. When Adam and Eve were exiled from Eden, they went to live in right outside its gates, in Hebron. They found a cave there, and searched its depths, and when they came to the end they started to dig. They could feel, wafting up through cracks in the earth, the cool air of the Garden. They dug until they heard a voice boom from heaven, commanding them to stop. When they died they were buried in that cave. Later, Abraham bought the cave as a burial plot for his wife Sarah. When he died too he was buried there by Isaac and Ishmael, and when Isaac died he was buried there by Jacob and Esau, and when Jacob died his body was carried from Egypt to be buried in the cave closest to Paradise. There was a shrine on the site from the 6th century BC; in the Second Temple period, it was enclosed in heavy square walls that still survive. This place has been a church, a synagogue, and a mosque, sometimes all three at the same time. On the 25th of February, 1994, an American from Brooklyn named Baruch Goldstein walked into the mosque with an IMI Galil AR assault rifle and opened fire. He killed twenty-nine worshippers, including children, and wounded over a hundred before being beaten to death. As people ran in terror, Israeli soldiers stationed outside the mosque opened fire on the crowd, killing several more. Goldstein is buried on a hill in the Kiryat Arba settlement overlooking Hebron, and some Jews still make pilgrimages to his grave.</p><p>We must assume that when Cain murdered Abel in the field, that field was also in Hebron.</p><p>Obviously, there’s some history I’m leaving out here. Hebron had a continuous Jewish population from the Iron Age until 1929. In that year, there was an Arab uprising across Palestine sparked by rumours that Zionists were planning to seize the al-Aqsa Mosque. In Hebron, mobs killed sixty-nine Jewish residents; some 450 others were sheltered by their Arab neighbours, and later evacuated by the British mandatory authorities. After Israeli forces captured the city in 1967, the settlement of Kiryat Arba was founded in an IDF base just outside the city. A decade later, a few dozen Jewish settlers from Kiryat Arba, mostly women and children, snuck into the old city of Hebron and started squatting in the ruins of the Beit Hadassah, a Jewish hospital from before 1929; the building was surrounded by Israeli soldiers. After they’d been living there for a year, the squatters were attacked: four gunmen opened fire on them as they were returning from prayers, killing six. In the aftermath, the Israeli government approved a new Jewish settlement that eventually grew to contain the entire old city of Hebron, including the cave where Adam and Eve are buried. Around 800 setlers live there now. It’s the only settlement in the West Bank that sits entirely within a Palestinian city. Enclosed by gates and checkpoints, and growing.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1638cb9f-0804-40cc-8672-b11866a55064_750x561.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1638cb9f-0804-40cc-8672-b11866a55064_750x561.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1638cb9f-0804-40cc-8672-b11866a55064_750x561.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1638cb9f-0804-40cc-8672-b11866a55064_750x561.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1638cb9f-0804-40cc-8672-b11866a55064_750x561.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1638cb9f-0804-40cc-8672-b11866a55064_750x561.jpeg" width="750" height="561" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1638cb9f-0804-40cc-8672-b11866a55064_750x561.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:561,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:746447,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1638cb9f-0804-40cc-8672-b11866a55064_750x561.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1638cb9f-0804-40cc-8672-b11866a55064_750x561.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1638cb9f-0804-40cc-8672-b11866a55064_750x561.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1638cb9f-0804-40cc-8672-b11866a55064_750x561.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Getting to Hebron is not difficult. There’s a regular bus service to the heart of the settlement; you just take the 381 from Jerusalem Central Bus Station to Me’arat Hamahpela. Most Israelis don’t ever get on that bus. Why would they? Hebron is a war zone. Settlers and soldiers and Palestinians are pelted with stones, stabbed, shot dead in the streets. Every week there’s something. Not long before we arrived, it was Shabbat Chayei Sarah, when Jews read the Torah portion that describes Abraham’s purchase of the cave. To celebrate, thousands of settlers marched out of the settlement into the Palestinian Authority-governed side of Hebron, accompanied by a full bodyguard of IDF soldiers. They chanted ‘death to the Arabs’ and ‘a Jew is a soul, an Arab is the son of a whore.’ They ransacked the market, turned over stalls, broke everything in sight. They smashed the windows of Palestinian homes and threw stun grenades inside. Afterwards, the Israeli human rights group Breaking the Silence tried to meet Palestinian families in occupied Hebron; soldiers tackled the activists to the ground and punched them in the face.</p><p>Best to stay away. Hebron is for the Haredis. I was the only man on the 381 bus without a pair of payot flopping over my ears. My girlfriend was the only woman not wearing either a shawl, a wig, a frumpy frummer denim skirt, or an Army uniform. Children squirmed in their seats, screaming or chattering in American accents. One woman spent the entire journey mumbling loudly from her prayer book in what looked like ecstasy. She rocked back and forth in her seat, jumped up, hobbled down the aisle, and sat down in another seat, still rocking, offering up delighted praises to Hashem. </p><p>There were no checkpoints or barriers on this trip. Hebron is plugged in to the network of ‘settler roads,’ off-limits to Palestinian traffic, that run across the entire West Bank. Thousands of settlers use these roads to commute in to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv every day; the point is to make travelling into the settlements as easy as travelling within Israel proper. These roads also make travel between the scattered Palestinian enclaves very, very difficult. The bus took us down Highway 60, which follows the Way of the Patriarchs: the path that the Bible says Abraham took when he drove his herds through these hills. As we skirted Bethlehem, the road was surrounded by tall concrete walls: there to protect the highway from sniper atacks. Army outposts, stumpy concrete cylinders surrounded by litter and barbed wire. Most of the roads off the highway were closed. Fortified checkpoints, marked with a red sign in Hebrew and Arabic and strangely janky English:</p><blockquote><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text">This Road Leads To Area 'A'

The Entrance For Israeli
Citizens Is Forbidden,

And Is Against The Israeli Law</pre></div></blockquote><p>And on every hilltop, there they were. The settlements: these bland commuter utopias with their green lawns, their red pitched roofs, their tree-lined avenues, their tennis courts, their diners, their cinemas, these fragments of blank American suburbia where you can get fat off hamburgers and drive a big air-conditioned car, jabbed sharp-side-first into the rocks and the olive groves and the ancient sun-crusted landscape of the Middle East. Where your normal life, raising your kids and mowing the lawn, is an act of war against the land and everything in it. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00b924e2-2106-4cad-893c-aa4a1bed04fc_750x548.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00b924e2-2106-4cad-893c-aa4a1bed04fc_750x548.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00b924e2-2106-4cad-893c-aa4a1bed04fc_750x548.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00b924e2-2106-4cad-893c-aa4a1bed04fc_750x548.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00b924e2-2106-4cad-893c-aa4a1bed04fc_750x548.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00b924e2-2106-4cad-893c-aa4a1bed04fc_750x548.jpeg" width="750" height="548" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/00b924e2-2106-4cad-893c-aa4a1bed04fc_750x548.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:548,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:682635,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00b924e2-2106-4cad-893c-aa4a1bed04fc_750x548.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00b924e2-2106-4cad-893c-aa4a1bed04fc_750x548.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00b924e2-2106-4cad-893c-aa4a1bed04fc_750x548.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00b924e2-2106-4cad-893c-aa4a1bed04fc_750x548.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>According to Hebron’s settlers, they have spurred a Jewish renaissance in one of our oldest and holiest cities. In fact, they’ve made a wasteland. Everything the settlers touch turns to desert. The old market of Hebron is shuttered and crumbling, spiky with weeds and IDF machine-gun nests. Broken glass on the streets. Armoured cars making their rounds. On the walls of Army bunkers and abandoned Arab shops, I kept seeing ugly yellow posters bearing the ugly, flabby, amphibian face of Itamar Ben-Gvir. The streets were silent. All I could hear was the wind flapping through the Israeli flags that hang from every lamppost—and far away, the constant honking of traffic in the distant, still-living Arab part of town. An unfathomably eerie place. A mouldering nightmare. </p><p>The settlers have built new housing blocks here. Tight courtyards with little playgrounds on Astroturf, empty. One block stands on stilts, above the excavated ruins of a building from the Second Temple period. A smug desecration of the past. I watched a train of young yeshiva students, eight or nine years old, walk silently down the street, dressed in miniature suits with tzitzit and kippot. They were following their rabbi like ducklings. He had a long white beard, and an assault rifle over his shoulder.</p><p>On the top of a hill, the Chabadniks have built a cemetery. It’s a statement. <em>We’re staying here forever. This is where we’ve put the bones of our dead</em>. But the settlement hasn’t been here long, and there aren’t enough dead. The cemetery is a fenced-off square of barren rubble, litter-strewn, containing two marble graves and one furious rabid dog, which leapt at us barking and foaming when we tried to look at the inscription. We ran. I would not want to be buried here, in holy Hebron, beneath the Coke cans and the dogshit of mad dogs. I would prefer you to toss my corpse in a landfill, or mince it up for animal feed, before I let it be buried here.</p><p>Many of the buildings in the settlement are still occupied by the Palestinians that lived here before. They keep their shutters shut; some have protective cages over the windows. The settlers like to throw stones, and sometimes fire bombs. A few Palestinian children wandered around the backstreets. (Al-Shuhada, the main street in old Hebron, is entirely off-limits to Palestinians.) They were almost absurdly sweet and incredibly friendly. ‘Hello,’ one would say, walking up to us. ‘Hello,’ I’d say. He’d stick out his tiny hand and I’d shake it. They could tell that we were not soldiers and not settlers, but something else, and they wanted to know why we were here, but that was about the limit of their English. One just counted for me. ‘One, two, three, four!’ And he grinned. </p><p>I found Hebron incredibly depressing. It was almost inconceivable that this wasteland had been made by Jews, that <em>my</em> people and <em>my</em> religion could have created something so ungodly. I did not recognise myself in this mirror. Jews—like Mel Brooks, like Franz Kafka, like Albert Einstein, like Bruno Schulz, like Woody Allen, like the Coen brothers, like Walter Benjamin, like me. People with sexual hangups and a good sense of humour. Bookish men with overbearing mothers. Latkes and lokshen pudding. Candles on a Friday night. Jews, the guilty conscience of Europe, the bearers of messianic hope through every generation—reduced to <em>this</em>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F716e91dc-dd58-428f-b928-2c894cc54d5c_750x560.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F716e91dc-dd58-428f-b928-2c894cc54d5c_750x560.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F716e91dc-dd58-428f-b928-2c894cc54d5c_750x560.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F716e91dc-dd58-428f-b928-2c894cc54d5c_750x560.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F716e91dc-dd58-428f-b928-2c894cc54d5c_750x560.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F716e91dc-dd58-428f-b928-2c894cc54d5c_750x560.jpeg" width="750" height="560" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/716e91dc-dd58-428f-b928-2c894cc54d5c_750x560.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:560,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:397259,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F716e91dc-dd58-428f-b928-2c894cc54d5c_750x560.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F716e91dc-dd58-428f-b928-2c894cc54d5c_750x560.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F716e91dc-dd58-428f-b928-2c894cc54d5c_750x560.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F716e91dc-dd58-428f-b928-2c894cc54d5c_750x560.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>We kept getting stopped by soldiers. The soldiers are everywhere in Hebron, hundreds of them; they almost outnumber the settlers. Heavily armed teenagers, tanned and muscular, wandering seemingly at random through the ghost town. They had also noticed that we were not among the settlers; they also wanted to know what we were doing there. Hebron is not a place for tourists. There’s no beach. There are no interesting eggs. Just the war, grinding in slow motion against the bodies of the living and the dead. The soldiers asked to see our passports. They asked us what our religion was, which is not a question I’ve ever been asked by any uniformed official anywhere else in the world. My girlfriend said she was a Christian. I said I was Jewish. At that, the soldiers beamed. ‘Jewish, good!’ they said. ‘Jewish, we like!’</p>

This is what everyone tells you to do: get out of the big cities and experience the calm and tranquility of small-town India. I’m just not sure you’re supposed to do it in Bihar. Even my Indian friends were very concerned to learn I was coming here, because among Indians Bihar has the same bad reputation India has in the rest of the world. According to the stereotype, Bihar is flat, dusty, polluted, chaotic, and poor. It has far too many people, and while they’re all wonderful on an individual level, genuine and hardworking, they’re also generally considered to be ignorant, illiterate, toothless, crippled petty criminals who practice rape as a form of light entertainment. Biharis keep migrating to greener, more prosperous parts of India, where they live in shanties and work for drastically lower wages than the locals, who often quickly and violently turn against them. In Bihar itself the bridges keep collapsing, the politicians keep getting arrested for corruption, and the rural population keep committing gory caste massacres in what’s effectively an undeclared civil war. Unfortunately, this stereotype comes with statistics. Bihar is India’s second-largest state, with nearly 130 million people. 89% of them live in rural areas, more than anywhere outside the Himalayas. It has the lowest average income, lowest GDP per capita, and highest poverty rate in the country. If Bihar were an independent country, it would be the tenth largest in the world, with more people than Japan or Mexico. It would also instantly become one of the poorest countries on the planet, behind such beacons of development as Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan. A population the size of Russia, forgotten under the belly of the world, and living at the extremes of human misery.</p><p>My train arrived just before six in the evening, which was a problem. Despite spanning nearly two thousand miles from east to west, India only has one time zone, which means that in the eastern regions it gets dark early, and the one thing everyone had told me about Bihar was that I should not go out at night. There’s no nightlife here. No cocktail bars. People drink, but they drink at home, and mostly just so they can beat their wives. There is no good reason to be on the streets after dark. Stay in your hotel and try not to make too much noise. You should absolutely not attempt to travel overland at night. The countryside teems with throat-slitting bandits, and tourists are routinely robbed. Unfortunately, our hotel was a good long drive from the train station, in a small town upriver surrounded by lots of dark, empty fields. One of my Indian friends told me to watch out for a cop outside the station. If we tried to arrange a lift without a cop’s help, there was a chance the driver would pull into a dark rural track, threaten me and my girlfriend with a knife, take our money and passports, and then leave our bodies by the side of the road. If we asked the policeman to find us a car, this was essentially guaranteed. Afterwards, the cop would get half the take.</p><p>So as our car squeaked and clattered over an unmarked and barely paved road, I kept the optimal route open on my phone, staring at the blue dot as it moved down along the blue line. As long as we’re on the line, everything’s fine. Nothing will hurt me as long as we’re on the line. It took about five minutes before the driver suddenly veered off it. Now we were on a lightless dirt track surrounded by low and lumpy mud huts. My girlfriend and I looked warily at each other. This is it, I thought. This is the day they’re finally going to hack me to death. We trundled deeper into the backlands, as our driver hummed a benign little tune to himself. I should do something, I thought. I could try to reach over and grab the wheel. I could garrotte him with my shoelace. I could refuse to go quietly. But instead, I noticed, I’m doing nothing. Any second now he’s going to pull over, drag me out the car, and cut me into thin slices with a machete, and I’m doing nothing. I’m watching the blue dot on my phone as it moves further and further in the wrong direction. But it was impossible to imagine that this ordinary car journey would really be what made the sun and the stars go out forever. That I could spend the next five minutes getting mildly carsick by scrolling on Instagram, and then be violently murdered at the end. The genres didn’t match. As long as I keep looking at my phone and doing nothing, I thought, this won’t turn into a struggle to the death in a moving vehicle. Pretend everything’s normal, and maybe I won’t even feel the blow that kills me…</p><p>The next morning, in the hotel room, I felt a bit silly about the whole thing. Clearly, I’d let myself be influenced by a cruel stereotype about this place. In reality, Bihar might have its struggles, but where doesn’t? It’s still a basically ordinary place, inhabited by basically ordinary people. In fact, we’d met some honeymooning Biharis in the south, and they’d been wonderful. They even gave me their phone number in case I decided to come to Patna. I’ve been in India long enough, I decided; there’s nothing here I haven’t seen before. And then, full of confidence, I went outside.</p><p>The hotel is on a squiggle of paved road running through the centre of town, loud with the beeping of motorcyclists as they fail to thread their way through the crowds. Away from there, the whole place crumbles into filth. My phone took us on a walk along a street that turned out to have been repurposed as an open sewer, fringed with green slime. Since no one drives down here any more, people have built shanties in the middle of it. They live directly on top of the slurry. Behind the Punjab National Bank there’s an enormous pit of sodden garbage. Black squealing piglets darting around between heaps of plastic and human waste. A corrugated-iron shack is luxury. People live in low hovels made of cow dung. They cook their food over burning cow-dung cakes. It’s a grey land: this is the breadbasket of India, but there’s something unwholesome about the earth here. This country imagines itself in lush green meadows, happy cows chomping on the grass, wooden pails full of pure white milk, vegetarianism, kindness towards all living creatures—and meanwhile, here in its agricultural heartland, the soil is all dust and famished, full of heavy metals, and the vegetables in the market stalls come scraggly and misshapen, shrivelled onions, anaemic tomatoes, limp scrags of cauliflowers, aubergines already rotting inside before they’re ripe. Nothing is fruitful. Nothing is plump.</p><p>The people come out the same way. This land mangles its inhabitants. In <em>Tristes Tropiques</em>, Lévi-Strauss sketches out a brief, non-structuralist account of the caste system: India simply has too many people, scratching out a living from a soil exhausted by six thousand years of intensive agriculture. ‘When a community becomes too numerous, however great the genius of its thinkers, it can only endure by secreting enslavement. Once men begin to feel cramped in their geographical, social and mental habitat, they are in danger of being tempted by the simple solution of denying one section of the species the right to be considered as human. This allows the rest a little elbow-room for a few more decades. Then it becomes necessary to extend the process of expulsion.’ In the end, you come to twenty-first century Bihar, where outright slavery has swallowed millions. The crowds that push and shove in front of each other are composed of the stunted and the afflicted. People with limbs bent in the wrong direction, joints locked, huge fibrous swellings, graceless zombie-walking, or some with parts of their bodies eaten away, skin asteroid-studded by parasites, withered legs all bone and nothing else, useless flappers for hands, red obliterated feet, some deformed from birth and some bashed or crushed until all the useful tendons and ligaments dissolve into swollen jelly, and some scattered people with their tongues loose, drooling, or looking up in boredom as small flies suck the moisture from the corners of their lips. </p><p>But the worst were the children. As soon as we stepped outside, the children started converging on us. Some of the children are barely five years old, but they wander the streets in pink pyjamas grey with dust, and their hair and faces are dust-grey too. Some of the children carry even younger children around with them, along with empty milk bottles. They walk up to you and start tapping you on the hand, or the thigh, or however high up they can reach, and ask for money. I didn’t want to give the children any money. Some of the local schools here have banners over the door that say ‘DON’T MAKE THEM BEG—LET YOUR CHILDREN LEARN,’ but a lot of parents seem to think that making them beg is the more lucrative option, and I didn’t want to prove them right. Instead, I decided to make a big donation to a charity working with Bihari street children. (I went with one called Rescue Junction; you can support their work <a href="https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/support-street-children-in-india/">here</a>.) But I wasn’t sure that telling the children I’d supported a charity that might maybe help someone like them at an unspecified point in the future would really be enough. My girlfriend had the idea of buying some fruit, so we’d have something to give other than money. I was doubtful: as soon as she offered them a nice apple, I said, they’d start tapping her wrist even more insistently. No, no fruit, money, money. But we bought some bananas from a street vendor anyway. </p><p>A few children hung around us, watching curiously. The moment she offered the first banana, they surged. Suddenly, my girlfriend was at the centre of a scrum of hungry pleas and snatching hands. She soon stopped even trying to dole out the fruit; she just stood helplessly, holding the bag as dozens of tiny fingers scrabbled through the plastic to grab a fistful of mushy bananas. The whole thing lasted less than thirty seconds, and afterwards the children all loped away without a word. There was only one left, a little boy who hadn’t managed to get a banana in time. He stood alone in the dust and bawled.</p><p>In the end, I think it would have been much less upsetting if the children had insisted on money instead.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1049706,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A month ago and half a world away, I was lucky enough to spend some of my time in Mumbai with <a href="https://kandivalilocal.substack.com/">Prithvi Pudhiarkar</a>, the poet laureate of Kandivali. (You should start reading him now; that way you can say you were on board before he went global.) Prithvi showed us the austere sacred caves overlooking the skyscrapers of the northern suburbs. The difference between India and the West, he said, is how we deal with suffering. India recognises that suffering is an inextricable part of life. The whole of Indian philosophy and mysticism is an attempt to overcome that suffering through deep mental discipline. You distance yourself from your own senses. Withdraw from the noisy world. The West, meanwhile, has tried to eliminate suffering by crude mechanical means. And in a way, that project has been incredibly successful. Once, the cities of Europe also had open cesspits, marching cripples, five-year-old beggars, and feral pigs eating human shit. Not any more. Back home, the kind of screaming poverty that’s grinding a hundred million Biharis into the dirt is gone. We’ve decided that the point of life is to be happy all the time, and so we banished human suffering from the visible realm. No one sees it; everyone publicly pretends that it doesn’t exist. But it does exist. Suffering really is an inextricable part of human existence; sooner or later, it will come for you, and the West simply has no good way of dealing with it. One of the most visible signs of the social decay in Western countries is opiate addiction. We experience physical or mental suffering and can’t cope, so we take painkillers, and in the end we get addicted to the act of blotting out our own pain. Prithvi imagined himself visiting me in London, and looking compassionately at all the lost and battered Westerners on the street. Businessmen in raincoats. Freelance programmers. Poor things: their lives are so hard, it really makes you count your blessings; just think, it’s a pure cosmic fluke that you were born in India and not somewhere miserable like here…</p><p>I think Prithvi’s insight is basically true, precisely because it’s such a big, sweeping generalisation. Yes, the West has a long stoic tradition; yes, the Indian approach to suffering has been part of our philosophy since Schopenhauer, and maybe since Pythagoras; yes, there are plenty of Indians who seem to think they can buy their way out of suffering, from the crorepatis in gilded penthouses to the beggars in the street. It doesn’t matter. The most boring thing about our age is its urge to nitpick, to needle for counterexamples. But there’s one counterexample to his thesis that’s been preying on me here in Bihar, which is the story of King Suddhodana.</p><p>Suddhodana lived around two and a half thousand years ago. The state he ruled was on the hilly, half-civilised fringes of the Gangetic plain, and it wasn’t really a kingdom. What government existed was carried out by a kind of tribal council of aristocratic warlords; Suddhodana happened to be the most powerful warlord in one particular clan. What matters is that for whatever reason, when his first son was born Suddhodana decided that this boy should get to live a life without any kind of suffering. He shouldn’t even experience a single negative thought. The prince grew up without ever leaving his father’s palace, which had been built as a kind of fortress against reality. Inside, everyone was young and beautiful. Any servants who fell ill were instantly dismissed. In the vast, lush gardens, the flowers were constantly uprooted and replaced so they appeared to be blooming all year round. The boy grew up happy, pampered, and stupid. He had never met a human being who wasn’t there to serve him, and all of them were constantly grinning. He knew the world existed only for his entertainment. He had never encountered sickness, age, or death. Two and a half thousand years ago, on the edge of India, Suddhodana invented the first world.</p><p>It didn’t work out the way he’d planned, though. The boy stayed in the walls of his palace until he was a man, twenty-nine years of chocolate for dinner, but eventually he got frustrated with the place. Since frustration is a form of suffering, Suddhodana had to let him go. But he prepared: before the prince left, he had the city cleaned, hung with banners, strewn with petals, and all the ugly people exiled to the hills. When his son emerged from the gate, it was to crowds of beautiful youths maniacally grinning at him. Still, you can’t sanitise the entire world. Not long into his tour, the price spotted, swaying on the edge of the adoring crowd, a feverish man with his face covered in pustules. In his dumb kindness he tried to rush over and help him, but his servants held him back. They explained that this man was sick, and if the prince came too close he’d get sick too. Later on there was the shadow of a bent-over crone, toothless and demented, and the prince tried to help her too. His servants were forced to tell him that there was nothing he could do; she was just old. Once, she was young. If you’re lucky, it’ll happen to you. When the prince saw a dead body being carried to the cremation pyre, he didn’t rush over to help this motionless man with his mouth open and his glazed-over eyes. He already knew. Finally, he saw an ascetic sitting emaciated and motionless on the ground, and his servants explained that this was a holy man, who performed gruelling austerities to escape the suffering of the world. Suddenly, the world seemed incredibly full of suffering. The prince decided to leave his father’s kingdom, renounce the world, and become a wandering ascetic. So he wandered the flat Gangetic plain, and saw suffering. He visited the holy city of Varanasi, where corpses are burned all day and all night by the banks of the Ganges, and saw death. He only ate a single jujube every day; he even tried to stop himself breathing. ‘My backside became like a camel's hoof; the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beads; my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barn.’ Somehow, none of this put an end to the suffering of the world, so after a few years of terrible austerities he started eating again. Eventually he came to a secluded place by the side of a river, and sat under a tree for seven weeks, deep in meditation. After seven weeks, he woke out the sleep he’d been in his entire life. You know the son of Suddhodana as the Awakened One. The Sanskrit word is <em>Buddha</em>.</p><p>I’m in this dusty, poisoned town in Bihar because this particular dusty, poisoned town is Bodh Gaya, where the Buddha attained enlightenment. According to tradition, this ground is sacred: if the prince had his realisation on any other patch of soil, the psychic shockwave unleashed by his ascent to Buddhahood would have torn a hole right through the earth itself. This is why this town is populated by cripples and beggars, who crowd here from every corner of Bihar to coax a few rupees out of the foreign pilgrims. This sacred slum is my last stop: from here, I start the journey back home to London. But without realising it, I’ve followed the Buddha’s path, winding along the north Indian plain through Varanasi until I arrived at this particular spot in Bihar. Like the Buddha, I have grown up in a pleasure-palace fortified against reality; like the Buddha, I have seen a lot of things that upset me. Maybe this is the place where I’ll finally wake up.</p><h4>A sick man: Delhi</h4><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2bee4b0-e6be-47a0-9017-f5d358d78258_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2bee4b0-e6be-47a0-9017-f5d358d78258_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2bee4b0-e6be-47a0-9017-f5d358d78258_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2bee4b0-e6be-47a0-9017-f5d358d78258_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2bee4b0-e6be-47a0-9017-f5d358d78258_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2bee4b0-e6be-47a0-9017-f5d358d78258_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d2bee4b0-e6be-47a0-9017-f5d358d78258_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2455142,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2bee4b0-e6be-47a0-9017-f5d358d78258_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2bee4b0-e6be-47a0-9017-f5d358d78258_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2bee4b0-e6be-47a0-9017-f5d358d78258_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2bee4b0-e6be-47a0-9017-f5d358d78258_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A few days ago, after making the long descent down from the fictional Indian state of Parpakainilam, I flew from Bangalore back to Delhi. My second time in the capital was not like the first. In the <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/numb-in-india-part-1-where-the-sun">very first instalment in this series</a>, I wrote from Shahjahanabad, the motheaten black hole at the centre of the city. I wandered down unpaved alleys wet with cow shit. I got in pointless arguments with tuktuk drivers. After several months in India, my appetite for that sort of thing had diminished. Back then, I came across a Delhi local complaining online about how foreign tourists go to the worst parts of his city and then get upset that they’re not very nice. ‘Just get 3, 4, 5 Star hotel. In South Delhi, roam, drive, shop in Central and South Delhi. That's it. Watch movies in IMAX. Shop at Big Malls. Eat at Good Restaurants. What more does anybody want?’ I found it very funny at the time. On my second visit, I found myself following his advice to the letter. A nice three-star hotel in South Extension I. Orderly blocks of streets, tidy apartment buildings, short Uber ride to the mall. No street food: Haldiram’s. Brunch in a little patisserie in Sunder Nagar, where they serve quinoa salads at Los Angeles prices, and I overheard a woman complaining at length—in English, of course—that her colleagues weren’t freeing up enough departmental resources for her research in subaltern studies. It felt impossible to believe that we were really in the same city as the squalor and collapse of Old Delhi. Later, we went to see <em>Gladiator II </em>at the Inox. Every time our scheming Romans downed a cup of wine, a warning flashed up in the corner of the screen: ‘DRINKING ALCOHOL IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH.’ I found that little feature particularly funny, given the situation. Because the other thing that was different on my second visit to Delhi was that the city was in a state of siege, and the air outside was poison.</p><p>This is what happens. Every year, when the monsoon ends and winter comes to north India, the convection currents that usually carry air into the upper atmosphere all fizzle out. A pool of stagnant, motionless air forms over the plains, close to the ground, hemmed in by the Deccan plateau to the south and the huge wall of the Himalayas to the north. Suddenly, seven hundred million people are pissing in their own bathtub. Everything lingers: the exhaust from all those rattling, beeping vehicles, half of which have been rigged to run on fermented straw and rat droppings; fumes from the thousands of brick kilns studding the countryside; smoke from the piles of plastic waste smouldering by the roadside. Meanwhile, farmers across Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh start helpfully burning the stubble left on their fields after harvest. This is more convenient than clearing it by hand, but it does involve loosing hundreds of thousands of tons of particulate matter into the air as it sits stagnant around them. Stubble burning is technically illegal in India, but it’s not like anyone cares. The result is that when I arrived in Delhi, I arrived in the single most polluted city on the planet. Officially, the AQI was at 500, but that’s only because 500 is as high as the scale goes. Scientists were throwing ridiculous numbers around. One thousand, twelve hundred. Nobody knew the real answer. Out of curiosity, I checked the figure for London, where the government keeps introducing wildly unpopular traffic restrictions to fight the rampant air pollution, which is shortening our lives and giving our children asthma. It was 2.</p><p>At night, Delhi is strangely beautiful. The world goes hazy; every particle in the air reflects the dull glow of streetlamps and headlights. The night in Delhi is full of microscopic moons. During the daytime, though, the whole city is wadded with grey. Technically there isn’t a cloud in the sky, but you can’t see a hint of blue up there; you can’t see to the end of the street. Even the trees aren’t green. There’s an ashy layer of rust-brown residue covering every leaf. You can <em>feel</em> the same gunk settling on your body. After a few seconds walking around outside, you taste it in your mouth, metallic and burnt. Like licking an ashtray. Breathing this stuff is physically painful: a sharp twinge in each inhale, and the background throb as all the jagged little molecules set about inflaming your lungs. Everyone in Delhi has some kind of horrible throat condition, but instead of a proper hacking cough they all just make strangled gurgling noises every three seconds. The streets are a chorus of phlegmy suffering. You can feel the pollution on your <em>eyeballs</em>. Wander the bougie bubble of South Delhi, drinking cocktails, eating salad, and all the while a soft, invisible rain of ashes drifts against the surface of your eyes, sucking at the moisture, until you feel the grit every time you blink. </p><p>The local government doesn’t just let this happen. When I arrived, Delhi had entered GRAP-IV, which is automatically triggered whenever the AQI reaches 450. Under GRAP-IV, heavy goods vehicles are forbidden from entering the city. Building sites are closed down. All vehicles with odd or even numberplates are banned from the roads on alternating days. Children stay home from school and pretend to learn over Zoom. Office workers go remote. The whole city battens down the hatches, withdraws in on itself, seals off the exits, settles in for the long war against its own air. A losing battle. Restrictions remain in place until the air quality improves, but they’re not enough, and the air quality is not going to improve. What do you do when the AQI reaches 1200? Emergency measures. State of exception. Squinting into the murk, I started to imagine strange shapes rising out of the haze. GRAP-V, not explicitly mentioned in any of the Graded Response Action Plans, but implicit in the whole structure. At GRAP-V, the Commission for Air Quality Management assumes dictatorial power over the entire capital region. All activity of any kind is forbidden. Power stations go offline. Hospitals close. Lie down wherever you can and try to breathe as shallowly as possible. Finally, at GRAP-VI, the emergency cull begins. Death squads in gas masks move like ghosts through the fug. The eliminations are not random, but there’s no way of knowing ahead of time whose name will be on the list. The Commission for Air Quality Management does not pity. In every neighbourhood the screams rise and are suddenly cut off. For clean fresh air, for fresh air and the blue sky above…</p><h4>An old crone: Ghabarabad</h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be42671-032f-4f22-98c8-97251af4d135_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be42671-032f-4f22-98c8-97251af4d135_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be42671-032f-4f22-98c8-97251af4d135_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be42671-032f-4f22-98c8-97251af4d135_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be42671-032f-4f22-98c8-97251af4d135_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be42671-032f-4f22-98c8-97251af4d135_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7be42671-032f-4f22-98c8-97251af4d135_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2935349,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be42671-032f-4f22-98c8-97251af4d135_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be42671-032f-4f22-98c8-97251af4d135_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be42671-032f-4f22-98c8-97251af4d135_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be42671-032f-4f22-98c8-97251af4d135_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The plan was to stop off in Agra to peer at the Taj Mahal, which was gorgeous even through the haze, and then try to leap across the whole of Uttar Pradesh as quickly as possible. Spend all day on a train, and you can be in Varanasi by evening. But the Vande Bharat was booked up, and we ended up chugging along the plains in a series of achingly slow trains that stopped at every dusty speck of a town along the way. Ghabarabad was one of those specks. This is where we ended up spending the night.</p><p>Ghabarabad is not actually called Ghabarabad. The state government changed it a few years ago; the original was too Persianate, too Mughal, so now it’s named after some fanatical Hindu supremacist from the 1920s. But it wasn’t really called Ghabarabad before either. Its name doesn’t matter. There are a thousand medium-sized towns exactly like Ghabarabad up and down the length of the state. It arranged around a main road, which runs parallel to the railway tracks, but just by the station, there’s a small grid of leafy green avenues and wide bungalows, built by the British so the wives of colonial administrators could pretend they were in Chingford instead of Uttar Pradesh. Cricket green, Norman-style church. That grid is inhabited by the local elite now, a small population of lawyers, landlords, moneylenders, and retired army officers. Just like in colonial times, it’s completely closed off. You can not just wander in there. Google street view does not cover the area. There’s only one road into the European Colony, and it’s manned by discreetly but heavily armed private security. We were not staying there. Ghabarabad has one hotel, the Varahi Business Inn, which is just off the main road, a short fifteen-minute walk from the train station. From the pictures online, it looked decent enough. Rooms naff but clean. There was even a pool. Varahi is a pig-headed night-goddess. Devotees will only worship her around midnight, in small furtive rites. Her nature and associations are obscure. This seemed fine.</p><p>Inside Ghabarabad station, there was a cardboard diorama showing the Chandrayaan-3 probe and a plastic rocket painted with the Indian flag. INDIA IS NOW ON THE MOON, said the sign. CONGRATULATIONS. Outside, it looked more like the Moon had come to India. Ghabarabad at night is postapocalyptic. That main road is an unpaved trench, rucked with pits and scars. Headlights swung through the haze, picking out fragments a landscape of utter rubble. Small fires glowered by the side of the road. Somehow, there were cows sitting patiently in the middle of this Somme-like devastation where no grass grows, chewing something that wasn’t grass. We paid two hundred and fifty rupees for a three-minute ride in a bouncing, clapped-out tuktuk, and for once I didn’t feel like I was being ripped off. The Varahi Business Inn had a marble-tiled floor in its entranceway, sprinkled with hundreds of dead flies. A stray dog had taken up residence there. As we passed it snapped up its head, showed its teeth for a moment, then decided we weren’t worth challenging and went back to sleep. In our room, the sheets and pillowcases in our room were covered in pale hardened stains. A business inn: a place for travelling salesmen to masturbate. Everything else—the table, the light switches, the floor—was glazed in a thin, sticky film of grime and neglect. Beneath the grime, though, the bathroom was also faced entirely in marble. Someone had cared about this place, once. Through the walls there was the faint but constant sound of a woman crying. We decided to head out for dinner.</p><p>Outside the European Colony, where anything might be happening, this town has one designated fancy restaurant, which is called RSK Fine Foods: Best Restaurant In Ghabarabad For All Fine Food Lover’s Ahhaaaaa. Photos showed a greasy, orangey mass that I eventually recognised as pizza, splattered with a white lacing of cheese, plus a few bits of shredded cabbage as a garnish. Unappetising. But there were a few decent-looking dhabas in the surrounding streets, so we made for one of those. According to my phone, it was a six-minute walk away. That turned out to be optimistic. The road had been torn up, but at least it was vaguely navigable by tuktuk; trying to walk along the <em>side</em> of the road was almost impossible. We had to scramble up piles of broken masonry and skirt around piss-filled ditches, discarded motorbikes, big hunks of abandoned industrial machinery, garbage fires billowing with plastic smoke. At one point the darkness spat out a dead dog, with its entrails smeared across the dirt. And here and there on the edge of all this devastation were small groups of men. Not talking, not going anywhere, not even looking at their phones, just standing. Usually, I can’t make it two minutes in India without someone asking what my good name is and what country I’m from, or commenting on my height, or begging for a selfie. I didn’t think I’d ever miss those constant friendly interruptions, but I did. The men here just stood in clumps, watching us as we clambered over the wreckage of their town, waiting.</p><p>In India, especially in north India, and <em>especially</em> in small towns like Ghabarabad, public space is for men. Sometimes, during the daytime, there are women, tottering after their husbands or moving in careful groups of three, usually in a hijab or dupatta, but the outside world does not belong to them. By night, they all but disappear. Everyone knows India has a problem with street harassment, groping, gang-rape; it’s why quite a few of my female friends have told me, basically unprompted, that they have absolutely no interest in ever setting foot in the country. Here, they call it ‘Eve teasing.’ But while the problem is real, we’re run into plenty of solo female travellers here, and not one of them had even been catcalled. India’s sex problem goes much deeper than straightforward male aggression. In the more traditional areas, there’s an informal system of sexual apartheid, enforced from childhood. It’s deeply shameful for a boy of five or fifteen to be seen near girls, to talk to girls, to have a girlfriend. For a girl of five or fifteen to talk to boys is unthinkable. Indian men have gained a reputation outside the country: maybe the best example comes from a Facebook post of a 1875 nude by the French academic painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau. All the comments were Indian men trying to seduce a painting. ‘Hello sexy dear friend how are you.’ ‘I kiss your full body.’ ‘I like you I love you I fill you and all day all night everyday everything u?’ Some of them left their numbers, in case a French model who died more than a century ago felt like giving them a call. But I do sort of understand their mad optimism. All they know is that in that women in the West are sexually available, in a way that women in India are not. The question of the other’s desire never really occurred to them. Why would it? They’ve never looked the other in her face.</p><p>Obviously this doesn’t apply to everyone. Kids will always find ways to be with each other, but here the risks are high. Outside the big cities, it’s dangerous for couples to walk hand in hand. Sometimes mobs will burst into the parks where young people go to make out; anyone suspected of kissing is pelted with rocks or beaten with iron bars. Self-appointed morality police mount raids on bars and clubs. Even marriage doesn’t offer much protection. Occasionally couples who’ve seen too many Western movies will try to kiss at their wedding; afterwards they’re sometimes arrested on obscenity charges. In fact, the actual police are always very happy to get involved in moral policing. Uttar Pradesh has the notorious ‘anti-Romeo’ squad, supposedly set up to stamp out sexual harassment; in fact, they mostly just intimidate, attack, or extort couples who show physical affection. In the West, these are two completely different things; in India, not so much. Just neighbouring fronts in the war against desire.</p><p>What holds together this whole fatberg of sexual repression is, of course, the institution of arranged marriage, which totally decouples the sexual relation from desire. Arranged marriage has a long history in India, but if you’ve read the great Hindu epics you’ll know it’s far from the only form available. In the <em>Mahabharata</em>, the great tragic father Bhishma attends a svayamvara for the daughters of the King of Varanasi. A svayamvara is a ceremony in which various eligible men present themselves in front of a woman and she chooses whichever one she wants to marry. Bhishma doesn’t play by the rules, though; he abducts all three daughters and carries them off. Rakshasa marriage, or marriage by abduction, is a sinful but legitimate form; so is paishacha, in which a man rapes a woman while she’s drugged or asleep. (The point isn’t to legitimise rape; if paishacha is a form of marriage, then any children born as a result have an equal claim on their father’s estate.) Despite kidnapping these women, though, Bhishma has taken a vow of celibacy. To prevent his line from going extinct, he agrees that his wives should be impregnated by a brahmin in his place. The brahmin chosen is the seer Vyasa, traditionally identified as the author of the Mahabharata itself. Vyasa descends from his higher plane of reality to fuck his own creations, while they tremble at his hideous face and powerful stench. It’s all very weird, but somewhere in this maze of possible relations Hinduism also makes room for smayamvara, or self-choice marriage, in which a couple agree to marry without their parents having anything to do with it at all, and brahmavivaha, which is the form we’d recognise as an arranged marriage. Of all the form of marriage, though, brahmavivaha is the most prestigious. Which is why, over the centuries, it slowly gained ground against the others. Contact with Western modernity and its own set of marriage norms did nothing to slow the process; today, it accounts for 93% of all marriages. What’s strange is that absolutely nobody seems to want to talk about it. </p><p>Well, not nobody. Bollywood talks about it a lot. The classic Bollywood plot is about a stern father who insists on marrying off his beautiful daughter to the gormless son of one of his old army friends; meanwhile she discovers, to her shock, that she’s fallen deeply in love with someone else. Our lovestruck couple make out on screen. They dance with each other in sexy, diaphanous costumes. In the end, love always wins over tradition. The Indian culture industry presents a set of norms and attitudes that’s basically diametrically opposed to those of Indian society at large. Maybe I’m the weird one for finding this weird: medieval Europe also produced a lot of highly formalised images of courtly love, and nobody expected their erotic lives to actually work like that. </p><p>But outside the world’s largest film industry, the silence falls heavy. My <em>Blackwell Companion to the Anthropology of India</em> devotes an entire section to the caste system, five essays over a hundred pages, but only one paragraph to the other great Indian institution of arranged marriage. (Apparently, it’s all because of the British.) In <em>The Argumentative Indian</em>, Amartya Sen dedicates a chapter to the question of ‘Women and Men,’ but doesn’t mention arranged marriage once. He discusses the fact that in India, newborn girls face higher mortality rates than newborn boys. He discusses the selective abortion of female foetuses. He notes that Indian women have less access to education, buy less property, own less capital, and do more housework than men. But somehow, Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen never noticed that unlike other unequal groups in society, men and women share a bed. Their relation is structured by the <em>sexual </em>relation, which means things you can’t plot on a graph: fantasy, violence, desire, the hollowness inside the self. Meanwhile, the sparse academic literature on arranged marriage that <em>does</em> exist strikes a very strange note. It’s not really interested in talking about arranged marriage at all, and much more interested in talking about the ways <em>other</em> people are talking about it. A lot of essays about the colonial, white-feminist gaze that upholds Western-style free-choice marriage as the only acceptable standard, without considering the particularities of the sex/gender systems of the societies of the global south. What else? Every so often, Western newspapers will publish a light little trend piece about how good old-fashioned arranged marriage might just be the solution to all our Millennial dating woes. Burned out on Bumble? Hopeless on Hinge? Did you know that couples in arranged marriages are dramatically less likely to divorce? Meanwhile, 45% of married women in Uttar Pradesh are beaten by husbands they never chose.</p><p>Anyway, we never made it to the dhaba. Eventually it got too unbearable outside to go any further. You can only walk past so many dead dogs. We ducked into a Smart Bazaar in the basement of a forlorn-looking mall, and grabbed some snacks to eat in our filthy hotel room. It was beautiful. As soon as we stepped into the hypermarket, the nightmare outside gave way to a bright, clean, organised wonderland. There were no entrails smeared across the linoleum floor. There were no wordless, motionless men hanging like corpses on gibbets in the dark. Absolutely nothing was on fire, and everyone was here for the same reason: to shop. We were not men or women, rich or poor, Indian or foreign: we were shoppers. Instantly I felt relaxed, confident, and eager to explore the interesting and unfamiliar products on the shelves around me. I felt bad for every time I’d complained that the same handful of chains have taken over every high street in London. I love chains. I love uniformity. Turn the whole planet into one big Sainsbury’s. A bright, clean, organised world, where everything is on sale. I love to process all human relations through the commodity-form. I love capitalism! Send me back, let me back into the palace they built for me, where you can buy strawberries in December and the flowers are always in bloom!</p><h4>A corpse: Varanasi</h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81544bd8-0781-4c04-97a5-14b606b14045_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81544bd8-0781-4c04-97a5-14b606b14045_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81544bd8-0781-4c04-97a5-14b606b14045_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81544bd8-0781-4c04-97a5-14b606b14045_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81544bd8-0781-4c04-97a5-14b606b14045_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81544bd8-0781-4c04-97a5-14b606b14045_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/81544bd8-0781-4c04-97a5-14b606b14045_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3981268,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81544bd8-0781-4c04-97a5-14b606b14045_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81544bd8-0781-4c04-97a5-14b606b14045_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81544bd8-0781-4c04-97a5-14b606b14045_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81544bd8-0781-4c04-97a5-14b606b14045_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Ada is eighty years old, Dutch, and mad. Her main way of being mad is to walk up to complete strangers and start talking to them as if she’s known them for years, and then act vaguely surprised when they talk back to her. I watched her do it over breakfast in our guesthouse in Varanasi. She was sitting in one corner in shorts, a strappy top, and various beads, when a family of Indian pilgrims arrived and sat down, parents looking at their phones, children bickering. Across the room, Ada’s eye gleamed. She finished her cigarette. Stalked over to their table on long naked legs, like an enormous, predatory wading bird, a shoebill stork about to pluck a frog out the water. Ah, good, she announced, you’re here. And how did the young ones sleep last night? She pinched one of the young ones’ cheeks. He looked up at her in outraged incomprehension. Good, said the mother. Good! said Ada. I was thinking that perhaps today we will tour the ghats, and we can go to a very lovely little restaurant I know for lunch. And in the evening we will be taking the Ganges boat tour for the festival, yes? And on she went, until the family hastily scoffed their dosas and fled. Then she stood up again. Her beak twitched in my direction. They’re pretending not to know me, she said, sitting down. I gave a neutral ah, as if this were a perfectly normal problem that happens to people all the time. Such is life. What was that? she said. You said something? What? I can’t hear you. I’m very old. </p><p>For nine months in the year, Ada lives in the tiny village of Zijderveld, just south of Utrecht. For the other three, around the festival of Dev Deepavali, she comes to Varanasi. It’s your first time here, she said. She didn’t need to ask; I guess it was written on my lightly shellshocked face. I have been coming here for forty years, she said. As soon as I saw this place, I fell in love. This is the most beautiful city on Earth. But it’s not so easy for people to love Varanasi. You have to let go of all your Western prejudices before you can understand. There is a secret, but you have to spend a long time here; for you, I think you will need to come to Varanasi maybe five, maybe ten times, and then you’ll learn to see it. </p><p>All the holy texts agree: this city has secret dimensions, invisible to those without understanding. For one thing, Varanasi is floating in the air, hundreds of miles above sea level, in the centre of the entire universe, midway between the earthly and heavenly realms, where the entire city balances on the tip of Shiva’s trident. According to the Skanda Purana, no part of Varanasi touches the ground, but ‘men of deluded intellect do not perceive it.’ The city was founded by Shiva himself at the beginning of everything. At first there was only Nigurna Shiva, Shiva without qualities, the pure and abstract principle of consciousness. But the gods wanted to look on him and worship him, and they begged him to take a visible form. The problem was that there was nowhere for his visible form to appear: back then, the entire physical realm was only a vast, churning ocean. So Shiva raised a spit of sand out of the ocean, and on that spit of sand he created a city for himself. There, he could appear as Saguna Shiva, Shiva with qualities, the familiar blue-skinned, three-eyed, long-haired man. Later, entire universes would rise out of that ocean like foam, but Varanasi was there first. It’s not just older than any other city on the planet, it’s older than the planet. Varanasi was here before there were people, before there were stars in the sky, before there was a sky. When all those things emerged, Shiva protected his city by lifting it on the point of his trident outside of space and time. Men of deluded intellect might see streets of breezeblock and cement hovels; they might see the train station built by the British, the mosque built by Aurangzeb, the enormous statue of praying hands built by the BJP; they might see a city with roads, traffic lights, a university, a huge locomotive factory on its outskirts. But they’re only looking through the veil of their senses, and they don’t see what’s really there. Varanasi is eternal and unchanging. You could not spend a weekend there, because the weekend does not pass. Nothing is built. Nothing is destroyed. Even when the entire universe is destroyed by four billion years of cosmic fire, Varanasi will be untouched. Shiva still holds court over the universe from his throne in Varanasi. He lives here, he walks the streets, he meditates by the riverside. His many-tiered capital rises high above the visible city, if you have eyes to see. He stands holding his trident, and on the very tip of the trident the entire city is balanced, including his capital, his throne, and his trident. If you have understanding, if your intellect is not deluded, this makes perfect sense. </p><p>The family from breakfast didn’t join Ada on the evening boat tour of the Ganges, but we did. On Dev Deepavali, the Diwali of the gods, all the Hindu deities come to Varanasi to bathe in the river, and the city is decked out in lights to welcome them. One million earthen lamps burn on the steps of the ghats, or float gently on the current downstream. Every building along the riverside is strung with fairy lights. It’s all incredibly beautiful, especially from the middle of the river. You don’t see the corrugated metal, the concrete water towers, the piles of dogshit, the lopsided temples half-sunken in the river slime: just one million flickering points of light. Varanasi’s holy name is Kashi, the city of light, the luminous one. The true nature of the place is invisible, but it comes out in pure, blinding light. I wanted to see what was behind the light, the way Ada could, but when I tried to ask her about it she was insistent that she’d never clapped eyes on me in her life, and had certainly never told me that there was a hidden city within or behind the ordinary city of Varanasi, or that I could learn to see it if I came back here another five or ten times. But she was happy to prattle away over the din of the engine. She said that the Ganges flows with the purest water in the world. In the senseless, sightless world of the Western mind, she admitted, the Ganges might be incredibly polluted, with three-quarters of north India’s sewage flowing untreated into its stream, but the young men swimming on the ghats do not live in that world. They live in the world of faith, and they see the Ganges as it really is, a metaphysical river, flowing from a source beyond the material universe. If you believe in Ganga Mata, how can she harm you? Ada offered to demonstrate by scooping up a handful of Ganges water and drinking it. No need, I said. This water cures every disease, she said hopefully. Absolutely, I said. She lit another cigarette instead. I noticed she had one of those roaring jet lighters, the kind people use to warm up a nice bowl of crack. </p><p>Every year, when Ada’s spending three months in Varanasi, her husband goes to South Africa. He’s a sport hunter. Picked off any number of kudu, nyala, blesbok; every so often a lion. He’s closer to ninety than eighty and his main joy in life is sending bright, innocent creatures ahead of him into the dark. He came to Varanasi with Ada once, and decided he never wanted to return. He found the place too morbid.</p><p>I get why. Varanasi is not the only holy city positioned at the centre of the world, halfway to Heaven. It’s not the only holy city with invisible dimensions curled up inside. In Jerusalem, you can see the Foundation Stone from which God created the earth. There is an invisible, messianic New Jerusalem already present in the cracks of the city that appears on a map. But Varanasi is outside of ordinary life in a much more fundamental way: this city belongs to death. If you die in Varanasi, you’re instantly liberated from the cycle of reincarnation. You’re already outside of space and time, floating hundreds of miles above the earth, right at the centre of the universe: how could you go back down there, to become a frog or an accountant? In Varanasi, Shiva himself appears invisibly beside the dying, and just before their hearts stop he whispers a mantra into their ears. And that’s it: their souls dissolve back into the universe. Every year, more than twenty thousand people come to Varanasi to die. Rich people come on chartered jets with their retinues of private doctors, but thousands more of the poor, gasping their last on trains and buses from every corner of India, tottering on crutches, navigating the narrow, crowded alleys of Varanasi in their dented old wheelchairs. Once they arrive they stay in hostels for the dying, bare concrete cells that charge by the day. Sometimes people will wait for years in these places. In the grand scale of things, it’s not so long. Their last pilgrimage to Varanasi isn’t just the culmination of one lifetime. They’ve been inching towards this place for billions of years, from one reincarnation to another, heaving themselves up the great ladder of being from amoeba to ape until finally they were born as a human being that could reach the summit of existence, in Kashi the city of death, and then disappear.</p><p>Before I came to Varanasi, I don’t think I’d ever seen a dead person in my life. I’d seen a coffin, a body wrapped in a shroud, I’d seen grainy war footage online, but I’d never actually looked directly into the empty face of a corpse. Historically, this is very unusual. For most people, death has always been an ordinary part of life. Dying was like going to the toilet, a biological function, and since everyone does it, they didn’t see much point in being precious about their privacy when their turn came. But modern Western society has tried to scrub it out of daily life. We don’t deny that death exists, exactly, but it’s no longer the natural endpoint of our existence; it’s an aberration, something wrong. Implicitly, dying is evidence of some kind of moral failure. There are exceptions: my brother works in a hospital, where he sees people die every day; there are people who have open-casket funerals; there are morticians; there are wars. But I still made it thirty-four years without ever seeing what a person looks like once they’re not a person any more, and I don’t think I’m the only one. In Varanasi, it barely lasted a day.</p><p>In every other Indian city, the cremation grounds are on the outskirts, hidden away. Here they’re in the centre of everything. The morning after Dev Deepavali, I took a walk along the riverside and found myself unexpectedly on Manikarnika Ghat, the burning-wharf. I knew this place existed, but it was nothing like I’d expected. I’d expected a wide, solemn stone platform, with dark flames burning in the rows of wide, solemn braziers. I’d expected the cleanliness of fire. Instead, there was a muddy pit half-enclosed with a rough screen of corrugated iron. Up above the pit were pieces of construction machinery, bright yellow excavators seemingly abandoned next to the slimy trench they’d dug out. Below, a group of Doms carried a corpse to the Ganges. A middle-aged man, bald, but with a fringe of still-dark hair around his ears. Rigor mortis had tensed his facial muscles into a final scowl. I looked at him in horror. I hadn’t expect the dead to have expressions. It felt like at any moment he might feel my eyes on him, and his own eyes might snap open in affront. Hey, pal, how about a little privacy here? Didn’t anyone ever tell you it’s rude to stare? Instead, the Doms dunked him briefly into the brown swilling Ganges, through its crust of paper plates, plastic bags, and other leavings from the previous night’s festival. The Doms are a caste of untouchables, condemned from birth to spend their lives burning corpses. Most of them live in shacks along the railway lines. The right to work on the ghats is doled out through the paari work-allocation system: supposedly, everyone gets an equal share; in practice, a few powerful Dom families make sure all the shifts are allocated to themselves, and then they subcontract out to everyone else for a fee. Meanwhile, Dom women are traditionally forbidden from working, or even leaving the home alone, while the men tend to drink away whatever they make on the ghats. So the women grow skinny. Malnutrition is common. Miscarriage is rife. These corpse-burners wore tattered old t-shirts, flip-flops, and impassive faces as they dumped the body on top of a pile of logs and set it alight. The little clump of mourners showed no sign of acknowledging their existence. They didn’t acknowledge much at all. Some were on their phones. There were now three pyres blazing in that muddy pit, and the ground around them was full of crud. Stamped-in scraps of cloth and loose bits of wood, plastic, cigarette ends, half-rotten flowers, charred pieces of bone. A few cows sat indifferently near the big yellow digger, watching the humans burn. Stray dogs wandered around the fires. One bitch, her enormous swaying udders full of creamy white dogmilk, was squatting near the piles of wood, squeezing out an enormous pile of slime. As I left, I noticed a patch of mud right by the corrugated-iron wall that reeked of human piss.</p><p>There are no graveyards for the people burned in Varanasi. No headstones, no urns. Once the fire goes out, your ashes and bones are collected and cast into the river, along with some of the other detritus on the ghat. And that’s it; you’re gone. I watched as a human form, a face that someone had worn for sixty years, went away into nothing at all.</p><p>Sometimes, though, the dead end up elsewhere. As I left the ghat, I noted the aghori squatting by the entrance. Aghoris are a Tantric sect, fiercely monistic. They believe that all opposites are false, every human soul is identical with the Ultimate Reality, and all of us could encompass everything that exists, if only we broke out of the illusion of the self. They’re more interested in individual spiritual discovery than the dogmas of priests and pandits; because they are a part of everything, they refuse to recognise the caste system, or the rules of ritual purity that make the Doms untouchable. There are aghori all over Varanasi, nearly naked, with long beards and coils of dreadlocks, and covered from head to toe in human ashes. Some of them carry human skulls, which they use as drinking-cups. They dart into the cremation grounds when a corpse is burned, to fish out any remaining body parts and eat them. If they find a body floating in the river, they eat it raw. Despite deliberately breaking every rule of Hindu life, the aghori are not reviled. No one seems to entirely mind if parts of Grandma end up as an aghori’s lunch. These are holy men; they carry an important truth. Everything that exists is a facet of God, and none of it is good or bad. </p><p>I think I came close, on Manikarnika Ghat, to breaking through into the beautiful Varanasi that Ada sees. The starkness of this place, the city on the edge of the void. There are a billion people who believe Varanasi is holy, and while they can see everything I see, they clearly know something I don’t. Life is transient, and the body is transient, but there is something beyond these transient things, beyond good and bad, and it’s beautiful like fire is beautiful. It stands in invisible columns of fire. But there was something small but insistent that kept tugging me back, away from those columns of fire and down towards the transient world. I couldn’t stop thinking about England. When people die in England, I thought, we bury them in a churchyard, a nice green garden full of trees and flowers, where the vicar announces his sure and certain hope in the resurrection of the dead. Later, frost settles. There will be a cold, clean winter’s day, when small birds hop between branches and sing, and little motes of steam puff from their warm and living throats. </p><h4>An ascetic: Bodh Gaya</h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac2f9f72-b760-4212-bdd7-b2e3b619f59f_3655x2737.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac2f9f72-b760-4212-bdd7-b2e3b619f59f_3655x2737.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac2f9f72-b760-4212-bdd7-b2e3b619f59f_3655x2737.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac2f9f72-b760-4212-bdd7-b2e3b619f59f_3655x2737.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac2f9f72-b760-4212-bdd7-b2e3b619f59f_3655x2737.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac2f9f72-b760-4212-bdd7-b2e3b619f59f_3655x2737.jpeg" width="1456" height="1090" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ac2f9f72-b760-4212-bdd7-b2e3b619f59f_3655x2737.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1090,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2277402,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac2f9f72-b760-4212-bdd7-b2e3b619f59f_3655x2737.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac2f9f72-b760-4212-bdd7-b2e3b619f59f_3655x2737.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac2f9f72-b760-4212-bdd7-b2e3b619f59f_3655x2737.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac2f9f72-b760-4212-bdd7-b2e3b619f59f_3655x2737.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Two and a half thousand years ago, a man sat down under a tree, and when he got up again he saw the world on fire.</p><p>Buddhism is a stark religion. In the West, you could have a very long argument over that tree. The man who sat there is gone, but there’s still a fig tree next to the Mahabodhi in Bodh Gaya: is it is the <em>same</em> fig tree that Siddhartha Gautama was sitting under when he became the Buddha? On the one hand, the original tree was destroyed a very long time ago. But a branch from that tree was brought to Sri Lanka in 236 BC and planted there, where it still lives, and much later a branch was replanted in India… Is that not, in some metaphysical sense, the same tree? Buddhism’s answer is a curt, tetchy no. Everything is impermanent; there is no essence, there is no soul; time consumes its creatures from moment to moment. It’s not even the same tree as when <em>I</em> sat there just a moment ago, and I’m not the same man. Early Buddhists refused to make images of the Buddha; when they had to represent him, it was with a pair of footprints: the mark of something that has gone. The world is a burning fire, and every seemingly solid object is only a brief wisp of smoke. So it would make very little sense for anyone to come on pilgrimage to this place, to sit by this tree, because there’s nothing here. But people are more sentimental than their religions. They’re here.</p><p>The entire Buddhist world is assembled in Bodh Gaya. The sacred bodhi tree, which doesn’t know it’s supposed to be sacred, sprawls madly in all directions. Here and there are iron posts to prop up its branches, or stop the tree running into the incredible spire of the Mahabodhi itself. Beneath its branches there are Vietnamese buddhist nuns in their grey robes, kissing the floor, a Tibetan getsul chanting sutras from his phone; a family of Taiwanese pilgrims in a corner, whispering, and a white American woman with her arms covered in tattoos, who’s been locked in prostration for the last hour, muttering fervently under her breath. In the lush green garden behind the temple there are fifty Burmese monks sitting in strict rows, in total silence, meditating. Further out some of the Japanese pilgrims have put up little mesh tents to stop the mosquitoes interrupting their focus. They sit cross-legged in a tiny antiseptic world. Around the edges are a few curious Indians. Some Hindus revere the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu; many Hindus regard Buddhism (and Jainism, and Sikhism) as a minor sect within their own religion. (Meanwhile, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs keep doing very un-Hindu things, like forbidding representations, or giving all their followers the same last name to erase caste divisions, in the desperate hope that someone might notice.) But the Hindus on the outskirts seemed antsy. Uncomfortable around this alien religion, and its heavy, haughty silence. </p><p>They might not be sitting under the same tree, but all these people are here for the same reason Siddhartha came here two and a half thousand years ago. He was looking for something, he wanted an answer, so he started wandering the valleys of India. We’re all here because India is a country with a secret. Somewhere in this enormous country, something has been hidden, an object of incredible significance and immense value. And this country does contain a lot of incredible things. Since I’ve been here, I’ve seen the endless white Himalayas, jewelled forts hunched over the cliffs, skies full of eagles, temple chariots taller than houses, the undeciphered writing of lost civilisations, and fields of skyscrapers thick as stalks of rice. I have rounded the southernmost tip of India, and it felt like brushing my hand against the edge of the world. I’m just one of the endless rush of people who have come to India to gawp at its treasures, photograph its art, steal its diamonds, melt down its silver, root around in its soil until you find the hidden thing. Maybe the secret isn’t something grand; maybe it’s very small. A single tree, near a single stream, in one dusty field in a country of five hundred million dusty fields. Some Mughal documents are decorated with tiny paintings of songbirds fluttering around the words, barely bigger than nuqta marks. One of those birds, in one of those documents, in every scrap of paper ever produced by an empire that lasted three hundred years, might be where the god stashed his treasure. But for the last century or so, foreigners have decided that the tiny hidden thing you’re looking for in India is yourself. The secret in India is not <em>about </em>India; it’s about you. These people are, it goes without saying, orientalists and fetishists and tourists and neocolonialists, turning a country of more than a billion people and more than five thousand years into a prop for their own inner drama, but in a way, I think they’re right. India does reveal something about the self to itself, because India is a <em>test</em>. The name of the test is suffering. And I think I might have failed.</p><p>Long after he’d become the Buddha, the son of Suddhodana remembered the day when he left his father’s palace and came face to face with the world. He described the lesson he’d learned from the sick man, the old crone, and the corpse. ‘When an untaught ordinary man, who is subject to sickness, age, and death, not safe from sickness, age, and death, sees another who is sick, aged, or dead, he is shocked, humiliated and disgusted, for he forgets that he himself is no exception. But I too am subject to sickness, age, and death, not safe from sickness, age, and death, and so it cannot befit me to be shocked, humiliated and disgusted on seeing another who is sick, aged, or dead. When I considered this, the vanity of life entirely left me.’ This was his first step to enlightenment. The young Prince Siddhartha didn’t <em>recoil</em> from the suffering he saw. He didn’t want to run away back to his palace of illusions. If he had, nobody today would remember his name. </p><p>Julia Kristeva teaches that the things that really horrify us are the things that disturb the integrity of the self. Not subject, not object, but abject. Things that cross the boundary of the body: food, shit, spit, vomit. Infections, abscesses, wounds. The sexual object: the body of the mother, the bowel-ridden darkness that men emerge out of and want to extinguish themselves within. Most of all, a corpse. ‘In that compelling, raw, insolent thing in the morgue's full sunlight, in that thing that no longer matches and therefore no longer signifies anything, I behold the breaking down of a world that has erased its borders: fainting away. The corpse, seen without God and outside of science, is the utmost of abjection. It is death infecting life.’ When we encounter something that horrifies us, we recoil. Push it away; put up the clear border. No, this is not me, I am me, this is this. Re-establish the I at the point where it seems to be collapsing. This is how, in a time before memory, the subject was constituted. The self is a residue of every horrifying thing you ever turned away from. But the Buddha, who was the first Freudian, says that the path to liberation lies through realising that <em>there is no self</em>, and the first step is not to recoil at the sick man, the old crone, or the corpse. This is not something else. This is not a foreign country. This is not the colonial other. This sickness, age, and death is me. I spewed the smog in Delhi; I lingered by the roads in Gabarabad; I am on the pyre in Varanasi. I might live without some specific sufferings, but I am not exempt from the suffering of the world.</p><p>This is the test. I don’t know if I <em>agree</em> with all this—I am not a Buddhist; I tend to think of liberation more in terms of economic redistribution than the extinction of all desire—but I would say that, since I’ve failed. At least I’m not alone in failing. I think this test is the root of the most glaring contradiction in Indian thought: on the one hand, from the earliest Upanishads onwards, it insists that everything is one, all consciousness is one, we’re all just Ultimate Reality wearing a series of masks; on the other hand, India has developed maybe the most brutal and dehumanising system of social stratifications on the planet, in which hundreds of millions of people are shunted out of the ranks of humanity on the basis of their poverty and suffering. This only looks like a contradiction from the outside, if you expect India to be a single object speaking with a single voice. From the inside, the answer is obvious. In the history of Indian thought, some people passed the test. Some did not. Some never had the chance.</p><p>Tomorrow I’m going home. I’m looking forward to it. I’ve spent far too long on holiday; after more than a few months of being a dumb tourist your brain starts to bruise. There is more of India to see, enough for a hundred lifetimes, but I won’t be seeing it. Not for now, anyway. I’m returning to the palace where they raised me, where the cars don’t honk and people say sorry instead of pushing and the only people leading lives of intense suffering on the streets are foreigners, addicts, and the mentally ill. I’m going to let the water trickle into my mouth when I shower. I’m going to eat a salad and sleep in my own comfy bed. But the test doesn’t end. After he woke up under the fig tree here in Bodh Gaya, the Buddha gathered a thousand ascetics just downriver, near the train station where the bandits wait. Everything, he said, is burning. The eye is burning, forms are burning, eye-consciousness is burning, eye-contact is burning. Burning with the fire of lust, with the fire of hate, with the fire of delusion. Burning with birth, ageing and death, with sorrows, with lamentations, with pains, with griefs, with despairs. The fire is not in the world; the fire is in the eye. The ear is burning, sounds are burning, ear-consciousness is burning, ear-contact is burning. The nose is burning, scents are burning. The mind is burning. Ideas are burning. They are burning more acutely here in Bihar, where the air tastes of ashes and every kind of filth clings to the surface of the world. But wherever you are, everything you see is burning too. </p>

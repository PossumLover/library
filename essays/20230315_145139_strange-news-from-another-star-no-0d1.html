Jack writes:</p><blockquote><p>In the dream I am a visitor to a strange land. A desert landscape. In this land there are multiple groups of people living separately from each other on the edge of a large body of water, like the Dead Sea but not. The landscape is chalky white. Dry heat.&nbsp;They are ultra-Essenes or something. White robes, mumbling, praying all the time. Classic sectarian weirdos.&nbsp;</p><p>Every group shares the same taboo: do not, under any circumstances,&nbsp;<em>step on the ground</em>. Each interprets this in different ways. Some have built houses on stilts, with complex wooden walkways in between; others have dug deep&nbsp;<em>under</em>&nbsp;the ground and live in cave systems. Others live on the water in a floating boat village and won’t touch dry land at all. They all think of ‘the ground’ as a slightly different thing, but all agree that stepping on the natural rock and mud and dust that make up the top layer of the earth’s surface is very very bad. If you touch this ground, something terrible will happen. I am a visitor to these places, I don’t know how I am moving around but I suppose I am floating, not wishing to offend my hosts.&nbsp;I obviously think this whole not stepping on the ground thing is quaint and ridiculous.</p><p>However, one day someone accidentally steps onto the desert surface. I see it happen. When the person lifts up their foot they leave behind a footprint-shaped pile of fresh pomegranate seeds. They&nbsp;glisten in the sun. Beautiful. Everyone is horrified. I am totally amazed.</p><p>Now, however, within the dream logic of this world, it emerges that stepping on the ground causes this small pile of seeds to instantly double in size. Quite soon it's huge, still retaining its footprint shape. Suddenly I am swimming on the surface of a massive footprint-shaped pile of pomegranate seeds, desperate to reach the edge before it doubles in size again, which it duly does and, presumably about to drown or suffocate, I wake up.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Jack suggests that ‘it might just be a sex dream.’ I’m not so sure. We can get the obvious interpretation out of the way: this is, like maybe every dream, a <em><a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/strange-news-from-another-star-no-9d3">death</a></em><a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/strange-news-from-another-star-no-9d3"> dream</a>. This white, parched, desert ground where nothing grows: Hades, the lifeless earth. The ground, not as <em>ge</em>, but as <em>chthon</em>. But what about the pomegranate seeds? In the Homeric hymn, Hades abducts Persephone, the beautiful goddess of green and growing things, and brings her into this underworld. Eventually the gods intercede and he’s compelled to release her, but before she goes he forces something into her mouth. She will not be able to enjoy the upper world for long, because she has eaten the fruit of Hades. ‘The berry of the pomegranate, that honey-sweet food.’</p><p>But the part that really interests me today is the prohibition: <em>do not step on the ground</em>. When we dream, we usually imagine ourselves to be <em>somewhere</em>, in a particular place and a particular space, moving around. We spend two-thirds of our lives in this world, and one-third in the other one. The other world has cities, deserts, villages, streets and roads leading from Place A to Place B. It has no actual dimensions, but it <em>feels </em>like it does. What kind of a world is this? Where are we, really? Do our feet ever actually touch the ground?</p><h4>1. China</h4><p>Most dreams take place in very familiar scenes. Children dream about going to school. When they grow up, a lot of them <em>continue</em> to dream about going to school. In the <em>Atlantic</em>, Kelly Conaboy writes about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/09/why-school-haunts-our-dreams-long-after-graduation/671506/">the strange persistence of school-dreams</a> among fully grown adults. At night, someone who hasn’t been in education for decades suddenly ‘has to rush to an exam after having overslept, or they can’t find their classroom, or they prepared for an exam by studying the wrong subject, or they sit down for an exam and the text is in hieroglyphics, or they show up to school nude.’ I’ve had a few of these myself. The other world, which is infinitely plastic, is mostly made up of very ordinary stuff. Schools, offices, supermarkets, occasionally public transport. But sometimes, you get to probe its more distant corners. Sometimes you can go on a trip. </p><p>Last time, I asked you to send in your dreams of distant or fantastic places. I also mentioned that I’d been having quite a few dreams set in China. If you’re trying to run some kind of scientific survey, this is exactly the kind of thing you must never do. Nearly half of the dreams you sent in were also set in China, and now I can’t be entirely sure whether this is because you’ve simply been dreaming about China, or because you’re all deeply suggestible and I can manipulate your most private dreams on a whim. One respondent mentioned that his girlfriend thinks he’s ‘started dreaming on request for <em>SNAS</em>.’ Still, I think it’s the former. China is big. And the China of the dreamworld also looms, big. </p><p>In his <em>Confessions of an English Opium Eater</em>, Thomas de Quincey writes about his opium dreams. First, he dreamed great fantastic cities and palaces. These dreams didn’t seem to have any particular narrative content; they just presented him with a vast and intricate <em>space</em>, domes and spires and endless secret staircases and passageways. Later, he started dreaming about bodies of water. First still, quiet lakes ‘shining like mirrors;’ then oceans. De Quincey started to worry when human faces started appearing in his dream-seas. ‘The sea appeared paved with innumerable faces upturned to the heavens—faces imploring, wrathful, despairing.’ But he knew he had to kick his opium habit for good when he started dreaming about Asia:</p><blockquote><p>I have been every night transported into Asiatic scenes. I have often thought that if I were compelled to forego England, and to live in China, and among Chinese manners and modes of life and scenery, I should go mad. The mere antiquity of Asiatic things, of their institutions, histories, modes of faith, &amp;c., is so impressive, that to me the vast age of the race and name overpowers the sense of youth in the individual. A young Chinese seems to me an antediluvian man renewed. In China, over and above what it has in common with the rest of southern Asia, I am terrified by the modes of life, by the manners, and the barrier of utter abhorrence and want of sympathy placed between us by feelings deeper than I can analyse. I could sooner live with lunatics or brute animals. All this, and much more than I can say or have time to say, the reader must enter into before he can comprehend the unimaginable horror which these dreams of Oriental imagery and mythological tortures impressed upon me. Under the connecting feeling of tropical heat and vertical sunlights I brought together all creatures, birds, beasts, reptiles, all trees and plants, usages and appearances, that are found in all tropical regions, and assembled them together in China or Indostan. From kindred feelings, I soon brought Egypt and all her gods under the same law. I was stared at, hooted at, grinned at, chattered at, by monkeys, by parroquets, by cockatoos. I ran into pagodas, and was fixed for centuries at the summit or in secret rooms: I was the idol; I was the priest; I was worshipped; I was sacrificed. I fled from the wrath of Brama through all the forests of Asia: Vishnu hated me: Seeva laid wait for me. I came suddenly upon Isis and Osiris: I had done a deed, they said, which the ibis and the crocodile trembled at. I was buried for a thousand years in stone coffins, with mummies and sphynxes, in narrow chambers at the heart of eternal pyramids. I was kissed, with cancerous kisses, by crocodiles; and laid, confounded with all unutterable slimy things, amongst reeds and Nilotic mud.</p></blockquote><p>De Quincey was writing in 1819, at a time when the British East India Company was busy shipping tens of thousands of kilos of his favourite drug into Chinese ports. A few decades later, when China tried to ban the trade, the Royal Navy forced opium on the country with a fleet of gunships and thousands dead. Still, it would be too much to imagine that this was de Quincey’s terrible deed, the one that had roused the fury of Isis and Osiris: that he was punishing himself in his sleep for his country’s sins, or that his repugnance for Asia was really a buried repugnance of <em>Britain</em>. It runs deeper: China seems to have a busy embassy in the other world. <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/strange-news-from-another-star-no-d92">Last time</a>, I briefly mentioned de Quincey’s friend and contemporary Samuel Taylor Coleridge, whose orientalist poem <em>Kubla Khan</em> was dictated to him in a dream. I also have China dreams. And so do you. </p><p>I’ve written about <a href="https://justinehsmith.substack.com/p/the-roaring-of-things-a-guest-essay">one of my China dreams</a> before, in Justin EH Smith’s Substack. (By the way, my stats page informs me that I have a 7% audience overlap with Justin—which, if I’m reading things right, means that 93% of you are somehow <em>not</em> reading his stuff. What are you doing? <a href="https://justinehsmith.substack.com/">Go over there</a> and sign up at once.) Here’s how it went:</p><blockquote><p>I am standing in an airport in China, trying to buy a plane ticket from an automated kiosk. In my dream, Chinese currency comes in small square coins, each stamped with a different character. Every transaction is also a message. When you pay for something, you’re supposed to hand over the coins in a particular order, to compose a nice poem with your money. It’s especially polite to pay with a few lines praising the object you’ve just bought. In my dream, I keep searching through my pockets, but all my coins mean things like <em>war</em> or <em>strife</em>, and anyway, I can’t read Chinese. When I feed my coins into the terminal, an error message pops up onscreen. Apparently I have threatened to assassinate a local official. Armed police are on their way.</p></blockquote><p>In another dream, a friend and I are exploring a dusty old brickworks somewhere in a half-abandoned industrial zone in China, full of clay-caked machinery and rusting iron poles. My friend finds a locked door and insists that we try to open it, which in a dream is never a good idea. Behind the door there’s a small, clean room, with a wide desk and a severe bureaucrat sitting behind it. She immediately starts upbraiding us for having entered this off-limits area, but not in words. She barks numbers at us, and we have to repeat those numbers back to her. The numbers refer to passages from the <em>Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung</em>, each of which lays out an important rule we’d just broken. Ashamed, we repeat our numbers and leave.</p><p>I remembered just one of Mao’s rules. Number 411: ‘A good Communist does not inhale loudly when he speaks.’ </p><p>Another Sam had a dream in a Chinese prison. They write:</p><blockquote><p>By some bureaucratic mishap, I am imprisoned in a forced labour camp. It’s an enormous warehouse, immaculately clean, and all prisoners wear orange jumpsuits and live inside separate but quite sizeable cages. The ‘labour’ isn’t what I’d expected at all: it’s a series of pointless tasks, some of which aren’t totally objectionable, and all commands are issued via a slightly treacly sounding robotic woman’s voice (think of the TikTok voice): ‘Smile into this camera!’ ‘Wave at one of the other prisoners!’ That sort of thing. All of the guards are women, and many of them are trying to have sex with me. One tells me that it won’t last long: prisoners don’t get to shave or shower regularly, they have poor diets, they don’t exercise. What she means is—they get ugly fairly quickly. </p></blockquote><p>One from an anonymous reader:</p><blockquote><p>Dreamed I was trying to make a journey in a Chinese metro system. I looked at the map, which had an English translation, but I couldn’t work out how to get where I was going because every single line in the system is named the ‘Warming Splash of Whisky Line’ and every station is called ‘Refreshing Gin.’ Apparently this was a publicity stunt by a Chinese dating app that didn’t quite work out, but they can’t change it back until all the people who use the metro are happily partnered up. Everyone else here is just as lost as I am, but we all just sit in silence scrolling on our phones. </p></blockquote><p>And from another:</p><blockquote><p>Wandering out of the desert I come upon a trailer park by the banks of a muddy creek. Nothing here seems particularly Chinese, but I know that I am in China. I have to stay here because the Chinese government has declared me to be a ‘Sudden and Serious Contaminant.’ Inside my trailer there’s a gleaming and fully-functional biolab, with doctors and scientists in full PPE rushing around, shouting orders. They take samples of my hair and swab under my toenails, which are coated in deadly bacteria. Finally I get to examine the bacteria under a microscope. They are tiny homunculi, all bearing my face. </p></blockquote><p>Uniquely, Mia’s China dream takes place in a specific city, Lengxing:</p><blockquote><p>I’m visiting my (real) sister who (in the dream) has moved to the Chinese city of Lengxing. In my dream the entire city is a huge shopping centre arranged around a single atrium, hundreds of storeys tall and so wide you can see clouds moving in its upper reaches. My sister is living in a bridal wear store; her bed and a couple of personal items are hidden away inside the skirts of a particularly lacy dress. Everyone here lives like this, all the homes are tucked away in the merchandise. This means that whenever you buy something it makes someone homeless. I really want to buy my sister’s dress-house for my wedding, but if I do she’ll have to camp out in the basement parking lot which is damp and full of rats. </p><p>I remember falling into the atrium, though I’m not sure how. The first thing I did on waking was to google Lengxing to see what it’s really like. Turns out there’s no such place. </p></blockquote><p>In George’s China dream, he’s working in a chicken factory:</p><blockquote><p>All chickens are assembled in China. Chicken assembly is exactly what it sounds like: there’s a big plastic tub full of chicken bones that I have to arrange, and then I need to dip them in a big vat full of molten chicken flesh before a stamping machine puts on the skin. Once it’s done, you end up with a raw chicken. All the other workers at the factory are Chinese and they’re all smoking cigarettes, with flecks of ash continually getting mixed into the chickens as they’re being assembled. I try to raise this with my boss, who’s a huge fat guy with a big white beard; I say that it feels unsanitary and he gives me a weird look. ‘You people are <em>eating</em> these things?’ he says. </p></blockquote><p>I think George’s dream gets at something important. We might be setting our dreams in China, but it’s those of us who spend our waking days in the barbarian hinterlands of the Central State who are eating these things.</p><p>The dream-China is made of baffling arbitrary systems, strange rules we have to follow without knowing why: a vast empire that does not make sense. But this is just <em>how the other world is governed</em>, in general. You could almost imagine that China functions as a kind of defence mechanism for the dream-work: if you’re dreaming, and you start to suspect that things seem a little too absurd, then the dream papers over the illusion by telling you that you’re <em>in China</em>, the land of obscure meanings and vast hidden bureaucracies where absurd things happen. And it’s true that China has been, and still is, governed by a vast, arbitrary, all-encompassing system of surveillance and control. Except—so is almost everywhere else. All the ‘Chinese’ features of these dreams are also perfectly ordinary facets of waking existence in the Western world. We perform banal actions for the approval of social media, anxious about our fading looks. We are lonely. Our lives are subsumed by retail experiences. These things would not show up in our dreams if they didn’t concern us. China is where we dream of ourselves.</p><p>There’s a long history here. Not all European writers had as dim a view of Chinese modes of life as Thomas de Quincey; the European Enlightenment was, in a sense, a project of Sinification. Thinkers like Voltaire and Leibniz deeply admired the rationalism of the Chinese imperial bureaucracy, with its open and universal exam system indifferent to feudal rank. So, by fits and starts, a similar system was built in Europe, mostly emerging out of the needs of a developing industrial bourgeoisie, but guided by the idealised China of the Western imagination. And when, a few generations later, this European system started to feel arbitrary and repressive, its arbitrariness assumed Chinese dimensions. You end up with Kafka’s <em>Great Wall of China</em>:</p><blockquote><p>They set out from their houses earlier than necessary, and half the village accompanied them for a long way. On all the roads there were groups of people, pennants, banners—they had never seen how great and rich and beautiful and endearing their country was. Every countryman was a brother for whom they were building a protective wall and who would thank him with everything he had and was for all his life. Unity! Unity! Shoulder to shoulder, a coordinated movement of the people, their blood no longer confined in the limited circulation of the body but rolling sweetly and yet still returning through the infinite extent of China.</p></blockquote><p>Kafka wrote this story in 1917, when his the bureaucracy of his own country—which was, at the time, the Dual Monarchy of Austria and Hungary—was busy throwing millions of lives at the barbed wire and machine-guns of the First World War. Blood rolling sweetly over the polluted mud and through rat-infested trenches. This was something very difficult to talk about. So you talk about somewhere else. You talk about Europe’s fantastic mirror-self, on the far edge of Eurasia. You talk about China.</p><p>This might work in the other direction too. I received one email from Wei, a reader in China who had dreams about the West:</p><blockquote><p>I have a recurring dream in which I’ve decided to move to New York. (I went to college in the Bay Area about a decade ago but I’ve never actually visited the East Coast.) In my dream I have to carry all my furnitue and possessions on a train which will take me to America; most recently this included an enormous bed with a headboard made of solid wood covered in ornate American carvings. (Think pilgrims with muskets, that sort of thing.) I am cramped in my seat with this huge bed ocupying the whole row. When I get off at the station in New York the city is cold and filthy, frozen dead bodies piled up in all the doorways. I drag my furniture to my new American apartment, which looks exactly like where I live in Guangzhou. Even the huge bed is already there. Every time I’m totally surprised by this and utterly demoralised that I’ve brought all of these heavy things here for no reason.</p></blockquote><p>The name ancient Chinese sources gave to the Roman Empire was <em>Daqin</em> or Great Qin: they had named it after the first Emperor of a unified China, Qin Shi Huang—which is to say, after themselves. </p><h4>2. Elsewhere</h4><p>There’s another possible explanation for the preponderance of China dreams: China is in the news a lot, and our dreams will recycle elements from waking life. As it happens, I didn’t always dream so much about China; for a good chunk of the 2010s, I had dozens of dreams set in <em>Syria</em>. Back then my journal was a bit sparser than it is now, but here are some samples:</p><blockquote><p>dream: my brother is getting married to bashar al-assad's daughter. big party in latakia. i wander away from the lights and festivities to stare miserably at the sea </p><p>dream: i have to go for my weekly shop but the nearest supermarket is a costco in the recently abandoned ruins of al-tanf </p><p>dream: i take a fun holiday in beseiged deir ez-zor, where the sole remaining industry is processing cat shit into tiny handbags </p><p>dream: i get mixed up with a gang of ruthless saudi foot fetishists masquerading as a syria relief fund</p><p>dream: i’m taking part in an air hockey championship in the desert. the syrian government is supporting me. they have posters of me shaking hands with assad. human rights groups want me to deliberately lose</p></blockquote><p>So maybe it’s not surprising that after China, the most frequent dream-location in your reports from the other world was Ukraine. Matthieu dreamed he was in Macron’s entourage during a visit to Kyiv. Macron was staying in a ‘luxury bunker’ beneath the city, drinking brandy and smoking cigars; above ground, Kyiv was a sterile landscape of ancient ruins with half-broken Corinthian columns scattered in the dust. In an anonymous reader’s dream, they were operating the last hot dog stand in Mariupol. ‘Desperate families kept coming up to me, asking to help get their children out the country. I said I couldn’t help them, I was just there to sell hot dogs.’ Łukasz dreamed he’d joined the Polish Army to fight against Russia. At an airfield, ‘we stand in a circle and try to mimic the moves of some army guy displayed on a relatively small screen. It's implied that this grotesque drill is the only training that we'll get before we go to war. Everything looks stupid and sad.’ </p><p>But sometimes the setting of a dream is meaningful in ways that are harder to decipher, like in this one:</p><blockquote><p>I’ve been accepted as a Masterchef contestant, which means I have to fly to South America with Greg Wallace. It’s only a small plane, a 12-seater maybe, and at a certain point in the flight we dip suddenly and veer around: evasive action. The plane descends into some woods, where a man with a rocket launcher lazily opens fire. Not far off, I can see that the ‘other’ plane (carrying John Torode?) has been hit; it explodes into flaming debris. Greg Wallace is muttering furiously to himself: ‘Stop firing rockets, stop firing rockets.’ Avoiding another missile, we fly low, barely pulling up in time to avoid hitting a dilapidated housing block with more assailants firing guns from the roof. In the distance, bombs are exploding. But this place looks like it used to be nice, there are lots of well-ordered towns and quiet fields. I ask where we are. Greg Wallace replies, with his lips peeled back in terror: ‘Eastern Denmark.’</p></blockquote><p>Another:</p><blockquote><p>Stuck in Vienna, in a slightly decaying hotel full of tropical plants. I’m flat broke and all the borders in Europe are closed; there’s some crisis. At the breakfast bar they serve me two slices of bread covered in patches of mould. I complain but they tell me this is <em>Möldenbröd</em>, it’s an Austrian staple, and I’m an idiot for not knowing that. ‘You eat blue cheese, don’t you?’ So I munch dejectedly on mouldy bread and wake up feeling deeply ashamed. </p></blockquote><p>Cora has had multiple dreams set in Iceland, where she’s never been. In one, Iceland is just off the coast of Antarctica, ‘jutting out from the ocean like a monstrous stalagmite.’ At the core of the block of ice was a small room, ‘having no ceiling, but walled on all sides by towering seracs,’ and containing dozens of exotic birds in cages. ‘One’s eyesight rapidly deteriorated in the room, due to an inability to tell the relative sizes of different objects.’ The same effect meant that this place ‘had never been photographed before;’ in fact, it was <em>impossible</em> to photograph. After thirty seconds in the heart of Iceland, Cora’s vision started to go blurry. Just before it went black, she saw these birds grow, filling her field of vision, brighter and more lurid and with human expressions, shining with a kind of cosmic consciousness far vaster than humans’.</p><p>(More—much more—on the room that can’t be photographed in the next section.)</p><p>Clearly, dream-places are not entirely like their real-world equivalents. I received two separate emails from people who dreamed about taking their girlfriends to Paris, which neither of them had ever been to while awake. But they seem to have visited very different places: the Paris of dreams is a protean, twisting city. In Cole’s dream, it’s ornate and enormous:</p><blockquote><p>It’s night in Paris, a rainy noirish neon-lit night. During our stay we’re posted in an apartment building of gargantuan proportions, a huge stone edifice dripping with Art Deco filigree. Inside, among the other wonders, there’s a full-size Romanesque cathedral spread over six floors; the ceiling of each floor is vaulted with great coffered rotundas. But our room is quite small and poky, and also windowless, even if it does have some nice ornate touches. A solitary oil lamp gleams from one corner. My girlfriend bursts into tears: this isn’t what she’d expected, and if I want this Paris trip to be perfect for her I need to find us somewhere else. Eventually it transpires that our place looks this way because it’s actually inside one of the cathedral’s organ pipes.</p></blockquote><p>Brad’s dream-Paris is not quite the same:</p><blockquote><p>Although I know this place is Paris, it doesn’t have any of the familiar landmarks. There’s no Eiffel Tower or Arc de Triomphe, and while we do see Sacré-Coeur, it’s lost its stone façade and been rebuilt in yellow industrial brick. Paris is a small town surrounded by grey densely wooded hills and the Siene is a brown trickle. It looks a bit like West Virginia. My girlfriend and I eat dinner at a Shoney’s near the Louvre, which is a big sawmill although I’m aware it still has the Mona Lisa. There’s only one other customer there, a fussy-looking Frenchman wearing a cheap suit. My girlfriend tells me that we need to slip some deadly poison into his food. Not for any particular reason, it’s just a fun game. </p></blockquote><p>Finally, Nick writes:</p><blockquote><p>Having moved three continents across my life, my dreams often take place in cities, some describable, identifiable, others not so much. More often than not, though, they are contorted in some way—the ocean is inevitably ink-black, the sky pink or bloodshot, the streets winding and darkly unfamiliar.&nbsp;</p><p>Funnily, the ones that seem sharpest, most true to life, are cities I haven't been to. I remember with immense clarity trying to flag down a taxi in the centre of what I thought in my head was Mombasa, which distinguished itself from many other cities which have appeared in my dreams by virtue of its total mundanity. Traffic flowed, the weather was suitably warm and overcast, and I couldn't help but think on awakening that I was hardly dreaming at all. One of the most 'beautiful' dream-cities I visited was Dakar, which was awash in the languid yellow light of late afternoon, the streets were florid with bougainvillea, and I bathed in a pool at the centre of a crystalline mosque. I woke up happy and refreshed.&nbsp;In another I was walking along the footpaths in a city I knew was in the Himalayas, Leh or Thimphu, but decades into some sort of gentrification. I ordered a flat white from a blonde woman at a curry house. It was a little like an icy Phnom Penh, the footpaths were studded with stupas, and there were gleaming new condos stood watch over the city.</p></blockquote><p>Of all the dreams of foreign places I’ve received, Nicks’s are closest to a particular genre of dream-writing. The master of this genre is HP Lovecraft, who alongside his more famous Cthulhu mythos gave us the Dream Cycle, with its pale WASPy protagonists vanishing at night into unknown lands:</p><blockquote><p>When Randolph Carter was thirty he lost the key of the gate of dreams. Prior to that time he had made up for the prosiness of life by nightly excursions to strange and ancient cities beyond space, and lovely, unbelievable garden lands across ethereal seas; but as middle age hardened upon him he felt these liberties slipping away little by little, until at last he was cut off altogether. No more could his galleys sail up the river Oukranos past the gilded spires of Thran, or his elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in Kled, where forgotten palaces with veined ivory columns sleep lovely and unbroken under the moon.</p></blockquote><p>And so on. What’s strange about these dream-worlds, really, is how <em>un</em>-dreamlike they are. In <em>The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath</em> there’s ‘the splendid city of Celephaïs in Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills’ and ‘the horrible stone villages on the icy desert plateau of Leng, which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar’—but all of these places are very clearly the product of a <em>waking</em> imagination. They resemble <em>this</em> world far more than they do the other one: Celephaïs and Leng are points in fixed space, arranged in a stable geography. They have <em>dimensions</em>. You could make a map of the Dreamlands; many people have. But in actual dreams, that kind of a map is impossible. You could not make a strictly geographical chart of Cole’s Paris or Cora’s space-warping Iceland, or the city where every metro station is called ‘Refreshing Gin.’ Once, I dreamed I was being followed by a gang of aggressive birwatchers around North London. I ducked around a corner onto the Kilburn High Road, but in this dream Kilburn precisely resembles Derech Jaffa in Tel Aviv. White concrete buildings with peeling plaster; worse drivers; a hotter sun. It’s both, at the same time, because <em>place</em> in dreams does not work the way it does in waking life.</p><p>But why not? And why do we keep assuming that it should?</p><h4>3. Nowhere</h4><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Often, when people try to describe their dreams, they’ll speak as if they’ve watched a kind of movie being acted out in front of their eyes. And some people definitely have more visually-oriented dreams than others—but <em>nobody</em>’s dream is purely sensory. You notice this most keenly when a dream plops you in a foreign place. Nick <em>knew</em> that the warm, ordinary city he visited in his dream was Mombasa—how? Brad knew that this dilapidated old logging town was actually Paris, city of lights—how? In dreams, you just know. The <em>placeliness</em> of a particular place has nothing to do with where it is (because it isn’t anywhere) or how it looks (because it might look like anything). In the waking world, geography comes first, and then we attach meaning to it. In the other world, geography is just another expression of thought.</p><p>But maybe the waking world is closer to dreams than we realise. </p><p>I was struck by one small feature of Cora’s dream-Iceland: at the centre of this place is an area that’s <em>impossible to photograph</em>, because you can’t tell the relative sizes of different objects. And actually, you can notice the same effect in ordinary life. Sometimes, I’ll turn a corner on the street to find a scene that looks interesting—but when I try to take a photo on my phone, everything comes out subtly <em>wrong</em>. Streetlamps or parking meters, which I’d hardly noticed before, keep cluttering up the image.  The object nicely framed in the distance: in the photo, it’s so small you barely notice it. Once, in France (the real one), I saw a ruined old Cathar castle perched on a tiny crag in some densely wooded hills. To my <em>sight</em>, that castle seemed to pop directly out of the landscape like a ripe zit. It felt far <em>larger</em> than the surrounding landscape. But when I tried to take a photo of the thing, I found it was hardly even visible, crowded out by the noise of everything else:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff602614e-b232-4b7c-b774-6682ecefb2d7_1227x920.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff602614e-b232-4b7c-b774-6682ecefb2d7_1227x920.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff602614e-b232-4b7c-b774-6682ecefb2d7_1227x920.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff602614e-b232-4b7c-b774-6682ecefb2d7_1227x920.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff602614e-b232-4b7c-b774-6682ecefb2d7_1227x920.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff602614e-b232-4b7c-b774-6682ecefb2d7_1227x920.jpeg" width="1227" height="920" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f602614e-b232-4b7c-b774-6682ecefb2d7_1227x920.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:920,&quot;width&quot;:1227,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:587283,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff602614e-b232-4b7c-b774-6682ecefb2d7_1227x920.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff602614e-b232-4b7c-b774-6682ecefb2d7_1227x920.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff602614e-b232-4b7c-b774-6682ecefb2d7_1227x920.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff602614e-b232-4b7c-b774-6682ecefb2d7_1227x920.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">I did eventually find a better angle</figcaption></figure></div><p>The problem is that the camera simply captures patterns of light, and the eye is not remotely like a camera. When you look at something, you’re not noticing splotches of brightness and colour; you’re inhabiting a <em>world of objects</em>, each of which are perceived distinctly before being stitched together into a visual image. The way that stitching-together works has just as much to do with our mental relation to those objects than any objective arrangement between them. This is why an important object in the distance seems to loom larger, while the things closer to you shrink around it. In <em>The World of Perception</em>, the phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty writes:</p><blockquote><p>Our relationship to space is not that of a pure disembodied subject to a distant object but rather that of a being which dwells in space relating to its natural habitat. This helps us to understand the famous optical illusion noted by Malebranche: when the moon is still on the horizon, it appears to be much larger than at its zenith. Malebranche assumed that human perception, by some process of reasoning, overestimates the size of the planet. If we look at it through a cardboard tube or the cover of a matchbox, the illusion disappears; so it is caused by the fact that, when the moon first appears, we glimpse it above the fields, walls and trees. This vast array of intervening objects makes us aware of being at so great a distance, from which we conclude that, in order to look as big as it does, notwithstanding this distance, the moon must indeed be very large. On this account, the perceiving subject is akin to the scientist who deliberates, assesses and concludes and the size we perceive is in fact the size we judge. This is not how most of today’s psychologists understand the illusion of the moon on the horizon. Systematic experimentation has allowed them to discover that it is generally true of our field of vision that the apparent size of objects on the horizontal plane is remarkably constant, whereas they very quickly get smaller on the vertical plane. This is most likely to be because, for us as beings who walk upon the earth, the horizontal plane is where our most important movements and activities take place. Thus what Malebranche attributed to the activity of a pure intellect, psychologists of this school put down to a natural property of our perceptual field, that of embodied beings who are forced to move about upon the surface of the earth. In psychology as in geometry, the notion of a single unified space entirely open to a disembodied intellect has been replaced by the idea of a space which consists of different regions and has certain privileged directions; these are closely related to our distinctive bodily features and our situation as beings thrown into the world.</p></blockquote><p>Part of the art of photography is trying to reproduce this effect with the right angles and the right framing: to summon space as a <em>meaningful</em> environment out of the raw materials of light. But for Merleau-Ponty, other art forms, like painting, can much more easily reproduce the grammar of sensory experience. </p><blockquote><p>Painting does not imitate the world but is a world of its own. This means that, in our encounter with a painting, at no stage are we sent back to the natural object; similarly, when we experience a portrait aesthetically, its ‘resemblance’ to the model is of no importance.</p></blockquote><p>What painting does imitate is not the object, but the <em>act of looking</em>. Merleau-Ponty’s canonical painter is Cézanne, who could ‘recapture and reproduce before our very eyes the birth of the landscape.’ The ‘classical’ painter tries to step outside of his own impressions and achieve a neutral, universal composite perspective. ‘Landscapes painted in this way have a peaceful look, an air of respectful decency, which comes of their being held beneath a gaze fixed at infinity.’ But with Cézanne, objects are ‘swelling and bursting free.’ Look at his 1904 <em>Château Noir</em>, which, just like my crappy phone photo of the Château de Durfort, shows a lonely wreck on its crag, half-hidden behind foliage. But in Cézanne, it bursts out of the background. <em>This</em> is what I actually saw:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59a5ef58-37c0-440c-bd33-323c60f3c6b7_1054x835.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59a5ef58-37c0-440c-bd33-323c60f3c6b7_1054x835.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59a5ef58-37c0-440c-bd33-323c60f3c6b7_1054x835.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59a5ef58-37c0-440c-bd33-323c60f3c6b7_1054x835.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59a5ef58-37c0-440c-bd33-323c60f3c6b7_1054x835.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59a5ef58-37c0-440c-bd33-323c60f3c6b7_1054x835.jpeg" width="1054" height="835" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/59a5ef58-37c0-440c-bd33-323c60f3c6b7_1054x835.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:835,&quot;width&quot;:1054,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:347280,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59a5ef58-37c0-440c-bd33-323c60f3c6b7_1054x835.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59a5ef58-37c0-440c-bd33-323c60f3c6b7_1054x835.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59a5ef58-37c0-440c-bd33-323c60f3c6b7_1054x835.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59a5ef58-37c0-440c-bd33-323c60f3c6b7_1054x835.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Merleau-Ponty neglects to mention that Cézanne didn’t invent this way of representing space. <em>Medieval</em> art, famously, did not use perspective either. Not because medieval artists weren’t aware that things in the distance apear smaller, but because that kind of arrangement was much less important than portraying things in the way that <em>mattered</em>—in which ‘up’ and ‘down’ and ‘near’ and ‘far’ have important psychological meanings.

Our lover falls asleep and finds himself in an allegorical garden, under the domain of Lord Pleasure, where he meets dancing women who represent Courtesy and Beauty and Idleness and Generosity of Spirit. But Jealousy has imprisoned the rose he loves in her castle, and he must build up an army and attack. Delight is nearly killed by Shame, who breaks his shield in half with a single blow of her sword. Pity, whose shield is ‘made of solace, bordered with groans and full of sighs and lamentations,’ manages to overcome Rebuff. It matters, in this illustration, that our knights are <em>outside</em> the castle, trying to fight their way in. They are in a place where place itself is full of meaning.</p><p>The ‘world of its own’ that Merleau-Ponty finds in painting is, of course, the world of dreams. What dreams present us with is a kind of <em>pure</em> perception, fully untethered from the object; the raw stuff of enworldedness. In a dream, the act of looking is allowed to simply run by itself; we get a glimpse of the conventions that structure our impressions of the waking world in their purest form. Compare Merleau-Ponty with our old friend James Hillman, writing about the meaning of space in dream-experience:</p><blockquote><p>Imaginary space is not a mere receptacle but comes already loaded with significances about ‘up’ and ‘down,’ ‘surface’ and ‘deep,’ ‘close’ and ‘remote.’ It brings with it ontological, esthetic and moral considerations that are reflected in many spiritual topographies. </p></blockquote><p>Medieval literature is full of dream-visions like the <em>Roman de la Rose</em>, and these texts are extraordinarily sensitive to the subtleties of imaginary place and space. The most famous of them, Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>, you already know: a map of the cosmos, made of words, that is also a map of the human soul. Or maybe you’ve encountered Langland’s <em>Piers Plowman</em>, the bane of every hungover literature student, with its allegorical dream-landscape:</p><blockquote><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text">Thanne gan I to meten a merveilouse swevene
That I was in a wildernesse, wist I never where;
Ac I bihelde into the est, an heigh to the sonne,
I seigh a toure on a toft, trielich y-maked,
A depe dale binethe, a dongeon thereinne,
With depe dyches and derke and dredful of sight.
A faire felde ful of folke fonde I there bytwene,
Of alle manner of men, the mene and the riche,
Worchyng and wandrying as the worlde asketh.</pre></div></blockquote><p>This place has a map, but it’s a map of <em>conceptual</em> relations. This dreamworld, like the Castle of Love and its environs, has far more in common with the actual workings of dreams than Celephaïs or Leng ever could. Heaven on its high toft; Hell in its deep dale, and our faire felde pitched between the two. This place is like your present-day dream-China: you can see it because it’s where you’re already living every day. You only need Langland to inch a little closer, and say:</p><blockquote><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text">What this montaigne bymeneth, and the merke dale,
And the felde ful of folke I shal yow faire schewe.</pre></div></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Anyway, next time we’ll be continuing this rummage around in the topologies of dreams, and thinking about some less distant spaces. What does it mean to walk around in the dream-version of your ordinary home when ‘up’ and ‘down’ are the same as Langland’s mountain and dale? <a href="mailto:samrkriss@gmail.com">Send me your dreams</a>.

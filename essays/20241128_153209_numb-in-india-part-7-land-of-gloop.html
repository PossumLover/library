It’s beautiful out, and I’m writing this in my swimming trunks while sipping a non-alcoholic mojito that includes, for some reason, little specks of sushi ginger floating around with the sprigs of mint. In a moment I’m going to go and get another of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life, which I will eat with my hands directly off a banana leaf. I’m enjoying a kind of holiday from my holiday, and if you’ve been following this series you’ll understand why I deserve one. (Thanks to everyone who successfully campaigned for my release; no thanks at all to the thousands of people who apparently thought my being arrested and sent to Indian jail was some kind of literary bit.) It’s nice here. I hear there’s been a cold snap back in London. I’m having an extremely nice time. </p><p>It took me three days to get down here from Mumbai, chugging along pretty much the entire length of peninsular India. When I did arrive, it was like arriving in another country. Down to the language: in the north, I’d got very used to the cadences of Hindi and Bengali and Marathi, which are all very rhythmic, rising and falling on the vowels, gummed together with consonants, <em>aapke aagey jaadu chalta hai</em>. I might not understand the words, but it’s audibly part of the same linguistic universe I come from, some distant relative of English. Here in Kerala they speak Malayalam, which is about as different from both English and Hindi as the click languages of Africa, or the Amazonian grammars where a noun’s declension depends on whether you saw it while entering or leaving the village, or the Siberian tundra-wails in which every verb has one million possible forms. In Malayalam, there are words like <em>vaidyuthiaagamanagamananiyanthranayanthram</em>, which is an electric switch. The capital of Kerala is called Thiruvananthapuram. All these words are written in a very beautiful script, which looks ഇതുപോലെ. The round, flowing forms are because Malayalam was originally written by being cut into palm leaves with a stylus, and straight lines would have torn through the fibres. Before I arrived here, though, I was wondering how any of this would actually be pronounced—up to and including the word <em>Malayalam</em> itself, which my tongue tends to slip around on like a bad ice skater. (Malayam? Mayalayalam? It’s not just me with this problem. Other Indians default to calling the people here Mallus, which is sometimes taken as an offensive slur, but it is objectively easier.) The answer is that these words are pronounced all at once. Instead of enunciating every syllable, <em>Thi-ru-va-nan-tha-pu-ram</em>, you just mash your jaw up and down while emitting a fast rhythmic bubbling sound. It is utterly unlike anything else I’ve ever heard in my life.</p><p>But everything is different here. In the north, cities and towns are scrunched fibrous cysts. Narrow brick houses packed together in the dust, all reeking of diesel fumes. Here, they sprawl. A Keralite town is more like an American suburb: big low homes with pitched roofs, dotted between wide expanses of lushly watered green. Another thing it will probably share with an American suburb is a huge gaudy church: Kerala has six million Christians, nearly a fifth of the state’s population. Also the steakhouse: in the north  of India cattle slaughter is illegal; in Kerala, even Hindus eat quite a lot of beef. But the resemblance ends there. In most of India, like most of the world, modernisation means <em>Westernisation</em>. This is why Delhi has artisan coffee shops with raw plaster on the walls, and Mumbai has some great small-plates restaurants, and every dusty town in Uttar Pradesh has a whole range of vegetarian burger bars. But Kerala is clearly guided by a different light. A white and gold aesthetic predominates. It’s hard to get a drink outside a few tourist hotels, but there are plenty of shisha bars. The fancy shops have signs in two languages: Malayalam and Arabic. Street food means dosas and uttapams but also, increasingly, shawarma. A lot of restaurants have two branches: one in Ernakulam, one in Abu Dhabi. </p><p>Kerala has always been the part of India most open to the rest of the world. Its Christian community was founded when the disciple Thomas sailed here to preach to the already long-established community of Malabar Jews. According to tradition, the first mosque in Kerala was built while Mohammed was still in exile in Medina. When Vasco de Gama arrived in India, he arrived here. So did the Dutch and the British. Today, that openness has led to a massive flow of migrant workers, remittances, health tourists, and cultural influence back and forth between Kerala and the UAE. The result is a version of India that’s visibly Christian but also Gulf Arab-flavoured. It’s also, incidentally, governed by the Communist Party, which has covered every city and every town in red hammer-and-sickle banners. At the market, the fresh fruit is sold on yesterday’s newspaper, which features a big double-page profile of Friedrich Engels, including a full explication of the <em>Naturdialektik</em> in Malayalam. It’s a weird place.</p><p>Kerala rarely comes up as a communist success story. I find this weird, since the seventy-odd years of intermittent communist government have clearly served the place well, without at any point involving any bread lines or nameless thousands shot and buried in shallow graves. Maybe this place has escaped the world’s attention because the communists in Kerala have had to do all their work in local government, where it’s harder to even <em>try</em> to abolish the value-form. Instead, they’re forced to simply administer capitalism, but it turns out that if you want someone to administer capitalism <em>well</em>, you could do a lot worse than a Communist Party. </p><p>Before the first communist government, a good chunk of the rural population were essentially slaves; meanwhile free peasants had to give over up to 75% of their crop to their landlords. The class struggle that followed was not bloodless. Across the state, there are monuments to peasant leaders murdered by landlords during the land reform campaign. A lot of people were hacked to death in their fields; in the end the Indian government decided that the communist programme was too radical, dismissed the elected state government, and declared direct rule from Delhi. But in the end the peasants won, and today Kerala has the lowest rural poverty rate in India, under 1%. The communists empowered trade unions, and today wages here are higher than anywhere else in the country. The average Indian farmworker makes just over 300 rupees a day; in Kerala it’s more like 800. </p><p>This has led to some problems. India as a whole is growing fast, but economic growth in Kerala is sclerotic, barely above first world-level, and the state has a hard time attracting capital. (This makes sense: as a good capitalist, would you prefer to build a factory in Bihar, where desperate peasants will beg you for a job, or in Kerala, where labour costs three times as much, your workers will immediately start scheming for your surplus, and the local government won’t even bash their heads in for you but might even back them up?) But there’s one other thing that communism has historically done extremely well, which is to provide an ideological structure that efficiently mobilises urban elites to go out into the countryside and provide healthcare and education to the rural poor. (Under noncommunist ideologies they usually go for a more well-remunerated but less socially useful version, like setting up an NGO to deliver corporate trainings on social equity.) The result is a huge surplus of well-educated Keralites, and like any other surplus in a well-run capitalist economy it ends up being exported abroad. </p><p>The UAE runs on Malayali engineers. In Britain, our NHS essentially parasites itself off the communist school system of Kerala. The revolutionary workers and peasants toil for universal education, and that education is realised in an oil despot’s thirtieth mansion or a few pills for a Scouse granny’s gammy knee. In return, of course, a chunk of the much higher foreign wages ends up coming back here, so people can live well in their green God-fearing suburb with Arab aesthetics and Communist slogans on all the walls. It’s not perfect, but it works.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Face186ca-201e-408f-b0a7-75c43fd1905e_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Face186ca-201e-408f-b0a7-75c43fd1905e_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Face186ca-201e-408f-b0a7-75c43fd1905e_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Face186ca-201e-408f-b0a7-75c43fd1905e_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Face186ca-201e-408f-b0a7-75c43fd1905e_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Face186ca-201e-408f-b0a7-75c43fd1905e_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ace186ca-201e-408f-b0a7-75c43fd1905e_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5553796,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Face186ca-201e-408f-b0a7-75c43fd1905e_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Face186ca-201e-408f-b0a7-75c43fd1905e_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Face186ca-201e-408f-b0a7-75c43fd1905e_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Face186ca-201e-408f-b0a7-75c43fd1905e_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I think this is not the India a lot of people are thinking about when they think about India.</p><p>This country has an image problem. In 2023, I was also in Asia, also in a place governed by a Communist Party that mostly just administers ordinary capitalism. But as I mentioned last time, readers do seem less interested in the India series than in China. A friend of mine admitted that despite being a progressive educated type, he has the sense that India is somehow <em>dirty</em>. China is cool, it’s <em>Blade Runner</em>, it’s a terrifyingly organised five-thousand-year-old cyborg dystopia. India is not cool. India is <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>. I ran a highly unscientific experiment on the kind of images of India and China people are receiving in the West, by noting down the reels Instagram’s algorithm has chosen to show me, which these days are almost entirely drawn from these two countries. The results look like this:</p><ul><li><p>Beautiful, fashionable Chinese woman walks around at night asking other beautiful, fashionable Chinese women to dump their boyfriends via text on camera; they all shrug and do it.</p></li><li><p>Weird, skinny Indian men hug a large stone idol while an almost naked, grotesquely fat priest pours various unsanitary-looking gloops over their heads.</p></li><li><p>Chinese guy sits in street food restaurant with his friends, eating noodles, drinking baiju, and smoking cigarettes; is unexpectedly poetic about smoking. ‘It’s the turbid air that sighs unwillingly.’</p></li><li><p>Indian cooks in street food restaurants cut meat between their toes, hold bread dough in their armpits, ineffectually swat at large clouds of flies, totally ignore enormous rats, and use their naked hands to dole out unsanitary-looking gloops.</p></li><li><p>A Chinese man has a little door in his wall that leads into a tiny, cosy living room he built for his pet cat, with a little sofa and a little coffee table and a little TV; in the wall there’s a tiny door that leads into a tiny, cosy living room he built for his pet hamster, with even smaller furniture; in the wall an extremely tiny door loads into a minuscule, cosy living room he built for his pet cricket.</p></li><li><p>A skinny, stunted Indian man grins while squatting on the mud floor of his hovel; the camera zooms in to reveal that his hair is visibly crawling with tens of thousands of lice.</p></li><li><p>Majestic bridges in rural China, extraordinary feats of engineering that span entire valleys.</p></li><li><p>Children in rural India pushing each other into an unsanitary-looking gloop-pool of what looks like liquid cow shit.</p></li></ul><p>It continues like this, six seconds at a time, twenty-four hours a day. Maybe this is, in part, a problem of perception; Kerala never seems to make it into these videos. But there’s not <em>nothing</em> there. This country really does have a lot of dirt. In 1950, China and India were two of the poorest places on the planet. Filthy, squalid, backwards, ignorant, addled. In the 1960s and 70s, India followed the path of sensible socialist-developmentalist economics, and incidentally became a major destination for millions of rich young Westerners seeking spiritual enlightenment. Meanwhile, China was pointlessly wiping out millions of its own people in enormous famines, political mass exterminations, and an undeclared civil war. In some parts of the country, political enemies were barbecued and eaten. Today, China is not just safe, clean, and prosperous; by any objective measure, it’s the coolest country in the world. India is the land of unsanitary gloops.

For me, the big moment came when I was at a regional airport. The government had clearly spent a lot of money installing automatic boarding pass gates. Normally, you approach these things and wave your boarding pass in front of the scanner, at which point a light turns green and the doors swoosh open to let you through. This is not how they work here. Instead, an official wearing a military-style uniform, a finely clipped moustache, and a sneer was posted in front of the gate. The system worked like this: you give <em>him</em> your boarding pass, and <em>he</em> scans it for you; once you’re through the gate he gives it back. In practice, this meant the formation of a small crowd in front of him, all waving their boarding passes in his face and clamouring for attention, while he haughtily surveyed the mob, deciding at his leisure which supplicant should receive his favour. Every time he did choose to scan someone’s boarding pass, there would be a huge row between the lucky traveller and various other people who all thought they ought to have gone first. Meanwhile the official kept one hand hovering over the neighbouring scanner to prevent anyone cutting out the middleman and just scanning their boarding pass for themselves. A process which takes seconds in the West dragged on for about twenty minutes. This man was drawing a salary from the airport; he was being <em>paid</em> to hold up the line for absolutely no good reason, and he was loving it. Ideologically, I’m deeply opposed to the over-optimisation of everything; I think whatever is deep and rich and valuable in human life can ultimately be described as a kind of inefficiency. A folding or complication around our straightforward utilitarian goals. On the other hand, I was late for my flight. Apparently, even I have limits.</p><p>Once you start seeing it, this kind of thing is everywhere. There are plenty of zebra crossings in India, but none of them seem to line up with the gaps in the big barrier running down the middle of the road. You can play a fun game in any hotel room, which is to count the number of light switches, count the number of lights, and then divide the first number by the second. Indian electricians all seem to agree that a room with maybe two ceiling lights, one wall light and a fan will need something on the order of eighteen switches, arranged in multiple banks around the walls. Is there any discernible relation between the location of a switch and the location of the light it controls? Take a guess! In a lot of shops it’s helpful to pay with exact change, because instead of organising their cash the shopkeeper will just have a drawer under the register full of loose banknotes. When I passed through Goa on my way down here, I noticed the place was littered with enormous plastic spools, standing taller than a man, by the side of the road. Clearly someone had been laying cables, and once the job was done they just left them there. Some of these spools had several years of vines growing over them. Further south, the police had come up with an ingenious way to slow traffic on two-lane highways, which is to randomly put barricades across half the road, forcing both streams of traffic to drive directly into each other. I have no idea how many people have died in head-on collisions because of these things, but I can personally confirm that they do absolutely nothing to slow drivers down. All across this great country, everyone seems determined to do things wrong.</p><p>In a celebrated 2013 study, a research team led by Nicholas Bloom tried to work out whether management consulting actually does anything by approaching two dozen Indian textile factories and offering them free training in extremely basic techniques, like double-entry bookkeeping and regular stock inspections. These were big family firms, successful, but they weren’t keeping their books properly, they had no idea how much inventory they had, and their workers kept getting horrifically mangled in the machines. Afterwards, the Americans found that firms that received their training were 10% more productive and 17% more profitable than the control firms, with fewer accidents. The researchers concluded that Indian firms are badly run because the local capitalist classes simply aren’t aware of modern management techniques, and you can improve things by teaching them. </p><p>I don’t even slightly buy this, but these people are <em>economists</em>; of course they can’t see what’s really going on. Indians do not need Americans to teach them about double-entry bookkeeping; merchants here were using bahi-khata hundreds of years before Luca Pacioli developed it in the West. Today, if Indian firms are fumbling around in the dark and constantly maiming their workforce, it’s not because they’re ignorant, it’s because <em>they prefer it this way</em>. When Bloom returned to India in 2017, he found that most of the firms had dropped at least one of his new techniques, even though they led to more profits. But why wouldn’t they want to be more efficient? Why wouldn’t they want to get rich?</p><p>Historically. India had a very different conception of these things. Few people had any Weberian delusions about working to <em>improve</em> your situation: you work because work is your dharma. This is what you been condemned to, by forces far beyond this world. The finished product hardly matters; it’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey. When you have such a vast population, when labour comes so incredibly cheap, and when there are infinite lifetimes in which to get something done, who cares about efficiency or productivity? VS Naipaul describes seeing street sweepers in Jaipur picking up the dust with their fingertips. A woman with ‘a tiny strip of rag held between her thumb and middle finger. Veiled, squatting, almost motionless, but present, earning her half-rupee, she does with her finger dabs in a day what a child can do with a single push of a long-handled broom. She is not expected to do more.’ </p><p>I saw something not too different in Delhi: another ancient, frail, hunched-over sweeper essentially moving dirt around in front of a shopping mall, beating the piled-up dust in the corners until it’s evenly scattered and then brushing it all into neat piles again. She was followed everywhere by a porky young man in a military-style uniform whose sole job seemed to consist in pointing out bits of dust she’d missed. His caste position forbade him from actually sweeping, his work was even more pointless than hers, but it was his dharma to order someone about, and the mall’s management happily accommodated him. Millions of people like that sweeper do humiliating jobs and live in miserable hovels, but the presence of massive, widespread poverty isn’t a <em>flaw</em> in the system either. Poverty has its place; at a certain point in life it’s entirely appropriate to shed all your wealth, renounce society, and become a wandering ascetic who survives by begging on the street. More endemic poverty, meanwhile, just means that the karmic system is working; the miserable masses are being punished for their misdeeds in a previous life. (In the meantime, they help more refined souls express their virtue through small acts of charity.) Why would you want to abolish poverty? That wouldn’t be justice, it would <em>decrease</em> the amount of justice in the world.</p><p>This is no longer how most people actually think. Most Indians are enthusiastic capitalists; bookshops are filled with stuff like <em>Think and Grow Rich</em> and <em>Atomic Habits</em>; they love and admire Elon Musk. But ideas are cheap, and the tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living, and while people here might <em>talk</em> like capitalists, it doesn’t stop them acting like feudalists. India never had a bourgeois revolution; instead of a social struggle, there were three centuries of religious and nationalist struggle against the Mughal and British empires. Indian independence was won under a particularly vapid anticolonialism, in which the removal of the foreign oppressors would spontaneously lead to the return of the enlightened rule of the god-kings. ‘Swaraj means Ramraj.’ Gandhi and Nehru were against poverty, of course, and even said so occasionally, but the only people in the independence movement with any real plan to address it were Ambedkar and a few fringe communists. Those communists have produced some progress in Kerala and West Bengal, and there was an attempted revolution in the east of the country that’s since festered into a gruelling, sixty-year-long rural insurgency. But elsewhere, even <em>textile factories in Mumbai</em> conceal a buried feudalism. The traditional Indian way of doing things has produced incredible art and literature, powerful systems of philosophical thought, and one of the world’s truly great civilisations. But it’s totally maladaptive for building a functioning capitalist economy.</p><p>Compare China. Last year, <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/numb-in-china-part-7">I entertained the idea</a> that third-world communism was never really anti-capitalist, and always actually anti-feudal. ‘Communism wrenches open the patriarchal family, emancipates women, slaughters landlords, attacks religion, and casts an atmosphere of suspicion and terror over ordinary social relations—all of which ends up supplying an enormous pool of free labour for future capitalist industry. Communism is a bourgeois revolution in a box, and you don’t even need a bourgeoisie to make it work: simply open it up, switch it on, and in thirty years all the picturesque poverty and peasants with interesting weatherbeaten faces will be gone, and your shiny new capitalist economy will enjoy double-digit growth.’ China spent the second half of the twentieth century violently exterminating its own traditional culture and turning its people into shellshocked monads. Officially, Confucianism is back, but it’s a shallow, deracinated Confucianism. ‘Respect your parents.’ Ok, great. If China were as attached to its traditional culture as India still is to its own, everyone would still be wearing the queue. There would still be a formal mandarin class, maybe stripped of its actual power, but ordinary people would still have to kowtow whenever they ran into one. Annual government campaigns gently encouraging people to stop binding women’s feet, without much effect. A maximum quota for eunuchs in the civil service. I guess Chinese people do still believe in chi, and they do still spit on the street. But the things that China underwent in the twentieth century are <em>impossible to imagine</em> here. </p><p>India could not have had a ‘Criticise Ram, Criticise Krishna’ campaign. (When Ambedkar’s critiques of the bluesome twosome were published after his death, it led to riots on the streets.) The Indian state could never have encouraged radical students to cover their campuses with slogans like ‘Time Is Linear And Progressive’ or ‘Eating Cows is Good.’ If anyone had tried to smash the temple idols, they would have been <em>lynched</em>. Here, anything that contravenes traditional values is basically impossible. For decades, some state governments here have been trying to combat rampant malnutrition—a third of all Indian children are stunted—by offering kids a single hard-boiled egg with their school lunches. They keep having to back down in the face of a furious response from parents and pressure groups. In India, eggs are considered non-vegetarian, and being non-veg violates the principle of kindness towards all living things. It’s low-caste, un-Hindu, filthy, disgusting. Multiple states have banned the egg. They will not allow malnourished children to eat a nice nutritious egg. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d3363c-bd32-4202-a606-b974ad5b10f4_3556x2667.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d3363c-bd32-4202-a606-b974ad5b10f4_3556x2667.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d3363c-bd32-4202-a606-b974ad5b10f4_3556x2667.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d3363c-bd32-4202-a606-b974ad5b10f4_3556x2667.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d3363c-bd32-4202-a606-b974ad5b10f4_3556x2667.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d3363c-bd32-4202-a606-b974ad5b10f4_3556x2667.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/10d3363c-bd32-4202-a606-b974ad5b10f4_3556x2667.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1055060,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d3363c-bd32-4202-a606-b974ad5b10f4_3556x2667.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d3363c-bd32-4202-a606-b974ad5b10f4_3556x2667.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d3363c-bd32-4202-a606-b974ad5b10f4_3556x2667.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d3363c-bd32-4202-a606-b974ad5b10f4_3556x2667.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>All this social unreason does have one major benefit, though: it’s allowed India to remain deeply lame. </p><p>This sounds like I’m twisting the knife, but bear with me. The facts, for what it’s worth, are undeniable. The world does not consider India cool. Consider that India has the world’s largest film industry, producing a constant stream of cheap commodity-culture slop—but while there’s an entire global youth subculture around the cheap commodity-culture slop produced by Japan, there is <em>no word</em> for a non-Indian obsessed with Bollywood. These films aren’t always bad—I loved <em>Kabhi Kushi Kabhie Gham</em>, and I promise that you will too—but they are undeniably corny. Humphrey Bogart didn’t grin through song and dance numbers. When I was in Punjab, I couldn’t move for posters of the wet lips and disconcertingly baby-like face of Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, making the namaste gesture in front of bountiful fields of wheat. Like a lot of Indian politicians, Mann came up through the entertainment industry. One of his roles was in a 2011 film called <em>Hero Hitler in Love</em>, about a guy called Hitler who’s the coolest man in his village. Early on in the film, armed Pakistani bandits take over the town; Hitler defeats them by walking slowly up to their leader and then slapping him in the face. He does this while wearing a sleeveless tshirt that says ‘Fcuk Google, Ask Me!’ It is not ironic.</p><p>The fact that he’s called Hitler is never explained, but Indians have a habit of naming things after Hitler, and by ‘things’ I mostly mean menswear stores. Apparently when people here think Hitler, they think denim. Ahmedabad has Hitler Men’s Wear, Hitler Menz Wear, Hitler Shoes, and Hitler ‘The King of Fashion.’ That last one has a nifty logo in which the ‘i’ in ‘Hitler’ is replaced with an Iron Cross that’s also a candle, and the centre of the flame is in the shape of a swastika. In Nagpur there’s one called Hitler The Brand, plus a mall called Hitler Point. Hitler Point’s logo is a stylised image of a man with a hipster beard and thick-framed glasses. He is not Adolf Hitler. Hyderabad has something called Hitler The Symbol of Passion. Occasionally the Anti-Defamation League catches wind of this and sends someone to blubber for the cameras about the threat small Indian shopkeepers pose to all Jews everywhere, but frankly I’d <em>prefer</em> it if these places were outrightly antisemitic, maybe selling leather coats and peaked caps and copies of the <em>Protocols</em>. At least that’s a coherent aesthetic. Instead, they’re all stocked with extremely skinny jeans, blue-tinted sunglasses, and tshirts that say things like ‘Fcuk Google, Ask Me!’ </p><p>India has a very strong prevailing vibe: Hobby Lobby-style sentimental kitsch, leavened with the occasional AI-generated image of a deity as a baby, and, apparently, Hitler. In all the most truly authentic, grease-splattered cafés and dhabas, every surface is covered in wall art, loopy lettering that says stuff like ‘Nothing Brings People Together Like Good Food’ or ‘Together Is Our Favourite Place To Be.’ Every other person is wearing a similar sentiment on their chest. When I went to the Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai, one of the country’s most prestigious contemporary art venues, it was exhibiting literally the worst dreck I have ever seen in my life. A painting of Marlon Brando as Don Corleone, sitting next to Bugs Bunny. Tom from <em>Tom &amp; Jerry</em> dancing in front of Elvis. They had a collection of paintings that seemed to belong in a Facebook post of <em>15 Images That Really Make You Think</em>. A human heart in a vase, sprouting flowers. A head, wearing an Indian flag facemask, split in two to represent the social divide. In another room, the artist had produced a copy of a Renaissance painting, but this time all the classical nudes were clutching bags from Bergdorf Goodman and iPads with Bored Ape NFTs.</p><p>This part is obviously more subjective, but there’s also a streak of Indian humour that’s unfunny in the most bizarre way I’ve ever encountered. Usually, unfunny people—the Germans, the Japanese—simply don’t make jokes. Occasionally there are unfunny people like the French, who think mime, slapstick, and cartoons of Mohammed are the peak of the comedic arts. In India, a lot of people are genuinely funny, like the tuktuk driver who spent our short trip careening wildly down the street while lisping ‘I have no licence, Mr Policeman, chase me, chase me!’ But many, many others seem to have fully internalised the <em>form</em> of a joke while understanding absolutely nothing of its content. During a bus trip, one of my fellow passengers asked me what I did for a living, and I told him. His eyes lit up. Ah, he said. You are writer—I am reader! I was about to ask him about his reading, but he turned to the others, grinning widely. Did you hear what I said? he said. I said, you are writer—I am reader! They all laughed heartily. It turned out that what had been told was a joke. At the top of the big hill overlooking the city in Udaipur, there’s a snack bar bearing a sign that says, in a fun, jaunty font, ‘WHY KILL? When still you can Chill.’ I understand how they got here. All the <em>ingredients</em> for a joke are present. There’s kind of wordplay, there’s a reversal; it even rhymes. Next to the snack bar was a toilet block, with two arrows. One said ‘MAN.’ One said ‘WOMEN are always right!’ I stared at the thing in utter confusion for some time, until I noticed that the sign had been painted over: originally, it had said ‘MAN to the left because WOMEN are always right!’ I don’t know how long it had been up like that before someone realised that the arrow for the women’s toilet was actually pointing left. </p><p>There’s something missing here. A kind of savviness: the glossy, disenchanted facility with signs we’re used to in the rest of the world. The West has decided that you shouldn’t be too enthusiastic about things. Don’t get all puppyish about very simple wordplay. If you have to dance, don’t grin too hard. Remain <em>cool</em>. There have always been a few people who can independently generate cool by doing whatever they want, like David Bowie, Joan Didion, and me, but for most people cool is a deeply conformist pose. It’s all about demonstrating that you’re in the know, and what you know are, more or less, <em>rules</em>. You have to send off a series of legible signals, indicating a deep familiarity with the established norms of your social group, while also pretending that you’re doing absolutely nothing of the sort. It’s self-abnegation dressed up as self-expression. This is not a game that India plays very well. In any beauty spot here you can watch Indian men taking each other’s photos with their blue-tinted sunglasses on, all adopting a smirking pose, face tilted down, chin between thumb and index finger, so visibly <em>trying</em>. Selfies do not jade them. Selfies are cool. But when India tries to be cool, it ends up naming clothes shops after Adolf Hitler.</p><p><em>Why</em> is India so lame? I think it might be connected with everything we’ve already seen. This country’s resistance to total capitalist atomisation has preserved a lot of very ugly feudal and patriarchal social forms—but in more efficient societies, the alternative seems to be having basically no social forms at all. In China you very quickly get used to a very depressing sight: you go to some starkly lit noodle bar for one of the best meals of your life, and notice that everyone else in the place is a man, sitting alone, efficiently slurping up his dinner while looking at his phone. Chinese people are exploring new frontiers in loneliness. Sometimes the socially isolated snap and murder a bunch of children at the local school, which happens in a lot of places, but in China the people who do this aren’t usually autistic twenty-year-olds who spend all day on 4chan; often, they’re sixty-year-old men, worn down by an entire loveless life. In China, the biggest shopping day of the year is November 11th, Singles Day, when people who don’t have anyone else in their lives just buy something for themselves. Still, it’s not like we’re too much better in the West. One of the most harrowing experiences of my life was in the Houston Street Whole Foods at five thirty on a Friday afternoon, when the whole place suddenly became rammed, Mumbai Metro-style, with glossy, savvy office workers buying their premade salmon teriyaki salad to take home and eat by themselves in front of Netflix.</p><p>The weird contradictions in cool—simultaneously detached, hyper-media-literate, and desperately conformist—strike me as an expression of precisely this sort of situation. This year, a study in <em>Collabra: Psychology</em> found that over the course of the twenty-first century, Westerners have put less and less emphasis on personal uniqueness. We no longer want to stand out from the crowd; we just want to fit in with our social group. A lot of people no longer have the kind of durable relationships that can accommodate genuine difference. India’s situation is not the same. People here are still half-suspended in the feudal context of clan, caste, and creed; all the stuff social conservatives like, the big repressive structures that give form to daily life. But I’m less interested in those structures themselves, and more interested in what they enable. In a high-grid society like India, you don’t <em>need</em> to play the game of sending deniable signals to establish your conformity, because all that stuff is highly formalised and already established ahead of time. Your don’t even need to do it to seek out a romantic partner, because a lot of the time your spouse is still selected for you by someone else. When Indians play the signalling game, they play badly, because there’s far less at stake. In the West, self-expression and the conformism of social positioning are all muddled together; in India, they’re much more distinct. Whatever you might have heard about a supposed Western individualism, the last holdout of the individual subject might be here, in India.</p><p>Near the beginning of this series I mentioned that while my country likes to think of itself as uniquely tolerant of personal eccentricity, Britain is nothing next to India. I wasn’t wrong. I’m only slightly exaggerating when I say that every single person I’ve met here has been, in some way, deeply weird. Everyone has some strange hobby or collection; people have stopped me on the street to talk about snooker or birdwatching, or to explain their own convoluted and idiosyncratic theology; kids fly homemade kites in the slums. The enjoyment of something does not take second place to its social status. The most visible manifestation of Indian individuality, though, is the emphasis on <em>friendship</em>. Everyone knows that Westerners have far fewer truly close friends than we did a few decades ago, and a depressingly large number have no close friends at all. India has managed to avoid this process: the average Indian has around three times as many friends as the average Brit. Friends here are intimate. Groups of young men with their arms around each other, sitting on each other’s laps, taking constant, identical selfies. Eighteen-year-olds do it, but eighty-year-olds do too. Old men with henna in their beards, friends since childhood, hobbling down the street. Friendship is significant, because unlike clan or caste or creed, friendship goes directly to the core of your individual being. Any true friendship is a relation between human subjects in their specificity, and not tedious demographic details. In the West, we’re losing our individuality, which means we’re less capable of sustaining friendship; what we’re left with is the wreckage of friendship, which we call the <em>social group</em>. We get efficient boarding pass gates at the airport, we get cities without enormous piles of rotting plastic on the streets, and our children grow up tall and strong. But there is a price. And when we peer outside our neurotic, homogenised, optimised world and encounter a place where there are still functioning human individuals, our instincts tell us that there’s something wrong. These people are failing to correctly act out the wriggling bee-dance that we perform in our hives. These people are lame.</p>

Siddique had been a councillor in the Municipal Corporation and a minister of state in the Maharashtra government; he’d sat on any number of important committees; he founded a political dynasty. He was gunned down by the Bishnoi gang outside his son’s constituency office for reasons unknown. Last time, I said I didn’t even know who Baba Siddique was until he was assassinated last month, and that’s true. Even so—and my lawyer has begged me not to write this bit, but my first duty is always to the truth—I’m not entirely innocent either. This is how I ended up here, and what happened next.</p><p>You have to understand what coming to Mumbai was like. For weeks, I’d been trudging around various dusty, dilapidated towns in Rajasthan, dutifully checking in on the historic palaces and the historic forts and the historic palaces inside the historic forts, half of them ruined, with bats hanging from the rafters and guano piling the floor where the tyrants of a less squalid age had once piled their gold and silks. I ate in godawful tourist restaurants with extensive menus full of burgers and fries. These people would have been horrified to discover what a burger really is, but that didn’t stop them selling any number of slimes between two buns under the name. I dodged tuktuks and human shit on narrow streets with no pavements, just a fringe of dust and heaped-up plastic, where I couldn’t walk for ten seconds without someone blocking my path—yes my friend! you want shopping? you want spend money?—proffering fake pashmina scarves or plastic idols or camel leather handbags or sometimes more ordinary things when there was nothing else to hawk, handfuls of broken masonry or bits of wood, biro caps, long ribbons of apple peel: yes my friend, you want pulp, you want chalk, you want worms? It’s a decaying world up there. Rajasthan is the most traditional, hidebound part of the country, but that doesn’t mean they’re interested in actually conserving the things they’ve received from the past, just that all they know how to do is moulder away. Brits and Israelis keep flocking to see the old forts and palaces, even if those forts are surrounded by a broad moat of filth; no need to live in anything other than comfortable squalor. Let it rot; all rot is picturesque. </p><p>Anyway, try to imagine what it was like for me to start the day in a dusty Rajasthani town on the edge of the desert, and arrive that evening in Mumbai. To drive down the Coastal Road and just see skyscrapers, hundreds of spindles of light all along the shore of the Arabian Sea, and more of them further inland, visible in the gaps between, thousands more: a city that <em>keeps going</em>, glittering endlessly for miles into the haze, and all of it superdense, all crushed and glowing like a neutron star. The hypercity; South Asia’s only real metropolis. In a country of one and a half billion people, this one city produces more than a third of the total tax revenue. Delhi might be big, in a strictly demographic sense, but it feels like a hypertrophied version of a poky little town. Mumbai feels <em>extraplanetary</em>. It keeps on going across the bay, into the sprawling warehouses of Navi Mumbai, liquid urban stuff flooding the hinterlands of Maharashtra; it keeps going beyond our world. Across asteroids and exoplanets there are tracts of slum housing and salvage zones, chipped signs in Hindi and Marathi in the warrens where bony stunted children take apart starships for scrap, street hawkers scurrying under skies with two suns or none at all. Coming here was like being dragged facefirst across the centuries, from the ruins of the eighteenth to the furnace of the twenty-third. </p><p>As soon as you see the skyscrapers, Mumbai’s famous slums make perfect sense. All of India floods into this one city, and I get it. If you were a Bihari peasant farmer, scraping dust out of the dust, shitting in a communal ditch, sleeping in the same one-room hut as your goats, as your ancestors had scraped and shat and slept for five thousand years—but you knew that you lived in the same country as Mumbai, this science-fiction city bursting with money and danger, you’d have to be an idiot not to go. So they come here, to live in slums. There’s no neighbourhood in Mumbai so ritzy it doesn’t have its slums. Malabar Hill has them, swelling like boils in between the towers. This is where all the energy of the city is generated. An overflowing pool of dirt-cheap labour, flooding into the cracks. Bataille once noted that nature is in constant high tension, exploding extravagantly: cut a path through a grassy field and new plants will immediately start growing in the bare earth. But you only get this rich fecundity when every individual organism is desperately poor, on the point of starvation, gasping for space in a saturated world. Mumbai is the same. If there’s six square feet of land along a railway track, or behind the back of some luxury mall, or in the gaps between office towers, someone’s already put up a lopsided corrugated-iron shack. Or, more likely, ten of them, a hundred, crammed together, sharing zero toilets. Whole families in a room, half the size of the one they shared with the goats back home.</p><p>But obviously not everyone here lives like grass. The fifty thousand dollar millionaires in this city, and the millions more in the comfortable middle classes, get to prance around in the meadow. It’s easy not to see the misery here if you don’t want to: I was too entranced by how nice it felt to be in a real city again. Mumbai has pavements. It has a big monumental downtown, partially built by the British, but mostly built by the local commercial classes in a high Victorian style. Gothic clock towers, all niches and gables. Neoclassical fountains featuring allegorical sculptures of nude women with tiny European tits, to represent Industry and Thrift and Cleanliness and Sexual Repression. Mumbai has a Zara and a Uniqlo and it’s even got Pret A Manger. Supermarkets too. Not a street market, not mud-crusted plastic buckets full of fly-crawling fruit, not skinned lambs dangling from their collarbones in the street, but shelves full of hygienically packaged products, all plastic-smooth. I could have been in Tesco. In fact, I was: the Star Bazaar supermarket chain is a 50-50 joint venture between the Tata Group and Tesco plc. And maybe it was the weird familiarity of this place that made me act out.</p><p>What you need to know is that Lawrence Bishnoi is currently India’s most feared gangster. He’s the man who orchestrated the murder of Baba Siddique; he’s also, according to the police, my boss. Bishnoi took the usual route into organised crime, which is to be born into the kind of respectable middle-class family that names its children after colonial-era British administrators, and then enter the underworld via the medium of student politics. While he was studying at Punjab University, Bishnoi ran for the student council and lost; next time, he realised that instead of risking another ordinary campaign, he could just threaten to kill anyone who voted the other way. He won, and was then promptly arrested. His time in jail changed his goals but not his strategy. This is how the Bishoi gang works: pure extortion. They don’t smuggle drugs, they don’t traffic women, they don’t make loans or organise illegal gambling; they just demand money and threaten to kill you if you don’t pay up. Sometimes, it’s true, they’ll kill you for other reasons. Bishnoi has vowed to kill the Bollywood actor Salman Khan over a 1998 poaching incident in which Khan shot an antelope. Lawrence Bishnoi comes from the Bishnoi panth, a caste of deeply religious tree-huggers from Rajasthan. In 1730, the Maharaja of Marwar sent soldiers to fell trees near a Bishnoi village for a new palace. Hundreds of villagers each wrapped their arms around a tree: if you want to cut this down, you’ll have to cut through me too. So they did: more than three hundred Bishnoi were sawn in half defending their trees. The Bishnoi worship all the gods, but they have a particular reverence for Agyana, god of blissful ignorance, and the antelope is his mount. Which is why, three hundred years later, Lawrence Bishnoi’s men fired a volley of gunshots at Salman Khan’s house. At least, that’s the official reason. But in the entertainment industry, nothing is what it seems. Not so long ago, everyone in Bollywood was gleefully murdering each other. Big men, famous men, shot down in the street so some actor could get out of a contract he didn’t like, or to secure international distribution rights for a frothy romance film with lots of song-and-dance numbers. And just when it looked like the bloodshed was finally winding down, the Lawrence Bishnoi gang moved into town with a laminated menu of execution methods, hired assassins to the stars. And now Bishnoi is killing politicians. Baba Siddique, local kingmaker, gunned down in the middle of Mumbai. Beyond that, things get too murky to see. According to the government of Canada, Indian intelligence is using the Bishnoi gang to murder Sikh separatists on Canadian soil. Bishnoi’s graduated into a greater game now, the game that produces the thing we call the world. </p><p>The police aren’t looking for Lawrence Bishnoi. They’ve already found him. For the last nine years, he’s directed his gang’s rise to supremacy in the Indian underworld from a cell in Sabermati Jail in Gujarat. Apparently, the authorities are powerless to stop him.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2087793,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>My own criminal history is less exciting, but when I was younger, I went through a shoplifting phase. Everyone does it, I’d tell myself, waddling out of Waterstones with a book in each armpit. Everything should belong to everyone, I’d think, scurrying out the supermarket with a big wedge of purloined cheese. Emerging from H&amp;M wearing four ugly shirts at once and a pair of sunglasses stuffed in my left sock, I’d reason that if they didn’t want me to steal this stuff, they should have simply caught me before I took it. I’m not proud of myself, but to be honest I’m not really that ashamed either. I was young and broke, and then I grew up a bit and stopped. What I am ashamed of are the thoughts I started having as I dutifully poked around the Hindu temples of the north. As I mentioned last time, my Jewish upbringing made me strangely uncomfortable with all the images and icons; what I didn’t tell you was that every time I saw some faithful doddering old man leave a ten-rupee note in front of the black figure of some god, I had a sudden and intense urge to just <em>grab it</em>. What did this idol need with money? Why not me instead? Obviously it would be unthinkable to actually do it: to come to a much poorer country and nakedly steal from its people: I wanted to believe that we British were actually past that sort of thing. But in Mumbai—some of the people in this place are <em>rich</em>. </p><p>In Malabar Hill I had a good gawp at Antilia, a private skyscraper one hundred and seventy metres tall, where Mukesh Ambani and his family live among floating badminton courts and six-storey elephant stables and an aquarium extending the entire height of the building for their beloved minke whale. Outside, the police have parked an actual tank. The soldiers guarding the naval port and military headquarters all have rusty old Russian rifles, but outside Antilia the cops are twitching with nasty little Belgian and Austrian submachine guns, all lasers and silencers and spectroscopic sights, ready to perforate any prole in sight at the first sign of trouble. Later, in a nearby temple, I watched a man in a moustache and a combover plonk down a slim but respectable stack of five-hundred-rupee notes in front of the god. The statue of Agyana, seated beatifically on his antelope, didn’t seem to acknowledge the gift, and when the bald man left I didn’t even think. I made the justifications to myself later, though. This holiday isn’t cheap, and unlike my big trip last year it doesn’t look like it’ll pay for itself. My subscribers are a good 30% less interested in the India series than my one on China, and whose fault is that? Not <em>mine</em>. My writing is impeccable. It’s this country’s fault, for failing to fascinate Western audiences to the same degree, and aren’t I owed some compensation? It took about an hour before my bullshit started to wear thin, and I decided to give the whole stack to the first beggar I saw. But it was only as I was counting out the notes that I noticed the little slip of paper folded within. It said:</p><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text"><em>Hello Sam

But it wasn’t enough to hold back the visions, the mobs that would soon form to spit on me or burn me alive for stealing from a temple, or the thrashing animal inside my chest that told me I’d deserve it. I kept telling myself how absolutely fine this was, how nothing would happen and it would all be fine. I clung to the passenger handle until the plastic started to creak. When I got out the car I was practically hallucinating with fear. It was dark out, and there was the constant sound of firecrackers, invisible people setting off firecrackers, maybe close. I crouched into the gloom. I was in a heap of those whitewashed tower blocks for rehabilitated slum dwellers. Barely a hand’s width for daylight between them; great tall grids of unglazed windows and grime. In the rooms that were lit I could see the peeling paint, the camp bed, the one-ring stove, the inhabitant sitting in front of the big square hole in his home, staring at nothing. In the rooms that were unlit, I thought I could see darker shapes, spikier, also in front of their windows, not staring at nothing but staring at <em>me… </em>The voice was soft, quiet, friendly, coming from the shadows of an abandoned shopfront. He spoke as if we were just making conversation. You know the man whose money you took? he said. He’s about to come out of that office over there. Take this. He handed me something. He was pale for an Indian and he had chubby cheeks. I remember his chubby cheeks; I remember thinking, in the middle of my frantic state, that he looked like one of the Alvin and the Chipmunks. He handed me the gun. I didn’t pull the trigger, I told Detective Shiv Vaktashirana. I saw the guy come out of his office but I just froze. It was someone else that killed him. Why would I do it? Please, just think, what kind of contract killer takes an Uber to the scene of the crime? I promise, as soon as it happened I dropped the gun and ran, you have to believe me…</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F631dc998-8494-4994-a366-091407af74ab_3886x2914.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F631dc998-8494-4994-a366-091407af74ab_3886x2914.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F631dc998-8494-4994-a366-091407af74ab_3886x2914.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F631dc998-8494-4994-a366-091407af74ab_3886x2914.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F631dc998-8494-4994-a366-091407af74ab_3886x2914.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F631dc998-8494-4994-a366-091407af74ab_3886x2914.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/631dc998-8494-4994-a366-091407af74ab_3886x2914.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1806791,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F631dc998-8494-4994-a366-091407af74ab_3886x2914.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F631dc998-8494-4994-a366-091407af74ab_3886x2914.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F631dc998-8494-4994-a366-091407af74ab_3886x2914.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F631dc998-8494-4994-a366-091407af74ab_3886x2914.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Detective Shiv Vaktashirana slouched out the interview room, with Vivek trotting smartly after him. Did you hear what that Britisher was saying, saar? said Vivek. Apparently Baba Siddique goes for darshan at the Agyana temple. He must think we’re chutiyas. I believe him, Shiv said. That fellow is far too pathetic to be anyone’s killer. If he was guilty, he wouldn’t have come up with such a ridiculous story. Vivek snickered. He had a high-pitched laugh, mucousy at the edges. You think he’s telling the truth? You think Baba was passing notes to his killers? Shiv’s shoulders managed to sag even lower than they had been. As if he’d crumpled like a Coke can inside his suit. I do, he said. Poor stupid bastard. I think he’s telling the truth. Hai Ram, the <em>truth</em>. That’s the last thing I need. Why does this happen to me, Vivek? Patel didn’t get put on the political angle. That fat harami Pansare didn’t get put on the political angle. Patel gets to round up crooked scrap dealers in Navi Mumbai. Pansare gets to squeeze into some body armour and parade around the slums for the TV cameras, picking up lowlifes… Who did I upset? I knew the Inspector General’s wife had something against me… You’re a good cop, saar, said Vivek. Bakwas, said Shiv. They were down in the basement cells now. You should apply for another job while you still have the chance, he said. This thing’s going to destroy me. I’m the fall guy. Dependable, expendable Shiv Vaktashirana.</p><p>There were armed guards outside the other prisoner’s cell. Unlike the Britisher, Nitin had been thoroughly roughed up before Shiv got to him. Unlike the Britisher, he looked totally comfortable in his chains. One leg up on the table, cigarette out the corner of his lips, bleeding insouciantly. He barely looked up as Shiv and Vivek walked in. I already told the last bunch of cops, he said, I did it. I shot that kutta Siddique. I don’t care. You think he was such a great guy? Vivek slapped the cigarette out his mouth. Look at the detective when you speak, he said. Nitin rolled his head upwards in one great sarcastic motion. A blood-matted, blonde-highlighted fringe flopped over his fringe. Happy? he said. Alright, said Shiv, enough games, just tell me… But tell what? Nitin almost certainly knew nothing about why Baba Siddique had to die. He was just the slum kid who’d pulled the trigger. If he was freely confessing, it was because going to prison was part of his reward, maybe the best thing that would ever happen for him; it meant promotion, it meant respect… But if by some chance the kid did actually know something, did Shiv even want to hear it? His job, maybe his life, depended on never ever actually finding out who had paid for the assassination of Baba Siddique or why. But if he did nothing, if he failed to pursue any leads at all, that was his career over too. His presence in this interrogation room was theatre, an elaborate form of timepass. But he’d waited a half-second too long to speak his demand, and now the kid knew it. </p><p>Arre! the kid crowed. He’s scared! Big tough cop, he’s scared! Hey, what you wanna know, sahab? Bolo na, kya chahiye? Shiv tried not to look like he’d been found out. The gora, he said, the Britisher. Why’d you get him involved? Nitin shrugged. Don’t know what you’re talking about. Yes you do, said Shiv. We’ve got him in a cell just upstairs. Seven feet tall and he keeps making faces like a kicked dog. Why’s he on CCTV with a gun in his hand? Nitin wiped the hair away from his eyes. His gaze was cold now. This is a thing, he said, that you only partially understand. We’re doing something big, na? Bigger than you can possibly imagine. Bade Bhai Lawrence, he sees everything, he knows everything, and when he wants you dead—and Nitin drew a finger across his throat with a smile—khatam. That’s what you’re scared of, isn’t it? You know you’re a small man in the dark, vardiwala sahab, with no one to guide you, and you know Lawrence Bishnoi is somewhere here in the dark with you, but you don’t know where…</p><p>Vivek slapped Nitin around a bit more after that. It helped. But not much.</p><p>Anyway, it wasn’t true that Shiv had no one to guide him. He had his political patron, just like everyone else. He was proud to be a pawn. It’s just that when he imagined Patel or Pansare or the Inspector General meeting their allies in the city government or the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly or the mafia underworld, he imagined them talking quietly in plush offices, or on the golf course, or in some neon-lit nightclub. Maybe there were martinis, cocaine, Ukrainian strippers. Meanwhile, Shiv’s patron was the Fleshpile, Municipal Corporator Mahbub Asim, and the Fleshpile received him in a tiny, filthy Irani hotel, where there was no AC but always a thin layer of grease on the glasses, and the Fleshpile sprawled across an entire booth, sweating profusely through his string vest. Shiva! he exclaimed. My boy! Come, come, pull up a pew. Talk to your friend Mahbub. How goes the big investigation? Shiv wedged himself into the booth. The Fleshpile’s belly extended some way under the table. It’s bakwas, said Shiv, you know it’s bakwas. The Fleshpile purred. Speak, speak, he said. Tell me what you have, and I’ll tell you what you lack. What I <em>lack</em>? said Shiv. Mahbub, there’s too much. There’s Bollywood. Siddique was all over it. His iftar parties were full of big actors and doe-eyed starlets… The Fleshpile grinned in a not entirely wholesome way. It is one of the consolations of a life given over to public service, he said, that an ugly man may enjoy the company of beautiful women. But continue. I talked to one of the girls, Shiv said. No one famous. Kept it all very low key. She’s been a backup dancer in a couple of films. But she was terrified of something, and she wouldn’t say what. Then there’s the real estate. Siddique ran Bandra East. Nothing happened there without his approval. The Slum Rehabilitation Authority, all that money flowing around every time a bunch of shacks get bulldozed for another high rise… I’ve got Siddique’s people telling me he was shot because he was standing up against the developers, fighting for a better deal for the slum dwellers, and then at the same time I’ve got his enemies saying he got greedy, started demanding a bigger and bigger cut… I don’t want to go up against the developers. That’s above my pay grade. But you know what I really don’t like, Mahbub? Siddique was a politician. When there’s a scrap dealer murdered, the culprit is usually another scrap dealer. When it’s some pimp dead in an alley somewhere, the killer’s another pimp. Siddique? He quit his party this year and shacked up with Ajit Parwar’s NCP. I don’t know why. I don’t <em>want</em> to know. But Mahbub, you’re in this world, and I need <em>something</em> here, something I can show my bosses and the public, to make it at least <em>look</em> like I’m doing my job. As he finished speaking, Shiv reached across the table, grabbed the Fleshpile’s glass, and drained it in one greasy, lukewarm gulp.</p><p>If I may, the Fleshpile ventured, retrieving the empty glass with a twitch of his luxuriantly cushioned hand, it strikes me that you’re overcomplicating things, no? From what I hear, this whole nasty business is the work of the Bishnoi gang. Chod yaar, said Shiv. You know as well as I do that there is no Bishnoi gang. The man who rules the Indian underworld from behind bars? That’s for the TV and the newspapers. Maybe you’ve even got the shooters believing in it. The kid in our cells seems to. But don’t pretend Lawrence Bishnoi is anything other than the name we use when something spills out of whatever hidden world you inhabit and leaves someone dead. Careful now, said the Fleshpile. Oh, I’m not accusing <em>you</em> of anything, said Shiv. But a politician is dead, Mahbub, a serious guy, and blaming it all on the Lawrence Bishnoi gang won’t cut it this time. So help me out, will you? The Fleshpile considered this. You have the tourist, don’t you? he said. Isn’t he some species of, ah, political writer? Spewing all manner of lunatic left-wing opinions online. I’m told there’s evidence he used to call himself a Maoist. Congratulations, Shiva! You’ve uncovered a crucial link, a conspiracy, between the Bishnoi gang and the international backers of Naxalite terrorism. Shiv’s mouth hung open. He’s a tourist in a Hawaiian shirt, Mahbub, he said. No one will believe that. <em>You</em> don’t believe anyone will believe it. You’re hanging me out to dry, aren’t you? You think you can just get rid of me? Like nothing’s changed. But everything’s fucked now, isn’t it? Now there’s two Nationalist Congress Parties and two Shiv Senas, and all the old alliances are falling apart, and no one knows what side of the bloody line they’re meant to be on any more, and there’s a lot of things about this that frighten me, but you, petu saala, are not one of them. The Fleshpile only smiled. Careful, my boy, he said, careful. There are things at work here of which you have only a partial understanding. Trembling with fury, Shiv marched out of the café. It was only later, as he was pacing hard around the corner, that he realised he’d heard that phrase before.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d630c5-515e-4453-99e6-61e2e843689b_3865x2898.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d630c5-515e-4453-99e6-61e2e843689b_3865x2898.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d630c5-515e-4453-99e6-61e2e843689b_3865x2898.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d630c5-515e-4453-99e6-61e2e843689b_3865x2898.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d630c5-515e-4453-99e6-61e2e843689b_3865x2898.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d630c5-515e-4453-99e6-61e2e843689b_3865x2898.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/82d630c5-515e-4453-99e6-61e2e843689b_3865x2898.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2508122,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d630c5-515e-4453-99e6-61e2e843689b_3865x2898.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d630c5-515e-4453-99e6-61e2e843689b_3865x2898.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d630c5-515e-4453-99e6-61e2e843689b_3865x2898.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d630c5-515e-4453-99e6-61e2e843689b_3865x2898.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Mahbub Asim wobbled splendidly up to an ordinary door in an ordinary housing society in the high-rise thickets of Goregaon. In the elevator, which he practically filled, someone had pasted a list of residents who were behind on their dues. Naughty, naughty, he hummed to himself. Naughty, naughty, Mr and Mrs Jain. Naughty, naughty, Mr and Mrs Kalchuri. Six lakhs you owe? What crooks, what crooks and thieves we are… The man who answered the door had an ordinary grey shirt and an ordinary grey face and a cat squeaking insistently from between his legs, begging to get out. Sorry about this, said the grey one. He’s new. Always trying to bolt, aren’t you? Come in, Mahbub. Careful you don’t tread on Yama. Mahbub walked in, gingerly, dancing around the cat as it made another mad dash for the door. He could be surprisingly deft on his toes. The grey one gestured at a grey Ikea sofa, and Mahbub sat. The effect he’d been hoping for had already been ruined, but he made his big declaration anyway. We need to get rid of Shiv Vaktashirana, he said. He’s gone off the rails. He may become an obstacle in our cause.</p><p>The grey one took this news with a look of mild disinterest, as if he’d just been told he had to switch to a new brand of cat food. Oh? he said. I thought Vaktashirana was one of your little pets. You told me—what did you say again? <em>A splendid mediocrity. He will fall with the utmost dignity.</em> But fine. Is that all? And it should have been all; if Mahbub knew what was good for him it would have been all. But the need to know was gnawing at him now. It merely occurs, he said, describing strange shapes in the air with one suddenly frantic hand, that my dealings with the more quotidian realities of our struggle might be, ah, <em>lubricated</em>, if I were privy to certain of the more tenebrous details surrounding recent events… You want to know why we killed Baba Siddique, said the grey one. Mahbub nodded, and when he spoke again his voice was very quiet. I knew him, he said. He was a good soldier. A decent Muslim. He was in the cause. These are things, said the grey one. Yes, yes, of which I am but partially aware, said Mahbub. But <em>bring</em> me to awareness. Ya Allah, understand that I am committed. The money, the kickbacks, the small shreds of power I enjoy over my fellow men—these I have never objected to. Does it thrill me, still, to march in here and command another’s death? Perhaps. I enjoy this part you have me play, the lubricious local chieftain. But above everything I love Bombay. You must see how it pains me to watch my city governed into the ground by this rotating cast of parochial imbeciles. Cow worshippers, dung eaters... People who, not so long ago, were tearing down street signs merely because they were written in Hindi instead of Marathi. What have I to do with some illiterate villager in the Deccan hills? I am a Mumbaikar. My hinterland is Dubai, Singapore, London, New York. Barely one fifth of this city even speaks Marathi, and those concentrated among the servile classes, but we remain chained to the vote banks of Aurangabad. What a narrow cage, when Bombay is all of India! Bigger, even—the universal city, the capital of the world! We <em>must</em> have our independence. I will play my part. I will infiltrate the political parties, the enemy government, as Baba Siddique did, and I will not flinch to die like he did either. All I ask is that I know! These things of which I am only partially aware—make me aware!</p><p>Through most of this speech, the grey one had been idly rearranging the tupperware in his fridge. We’ll sort out your policeman, he said. And if you want to know that badly… I do, said Mahbub Asim. You might not like what you discover, said the grey one. I want to know, said Mahbub. The grey one shrugged. Fine, he said. Expect a call. He waved a takeaway container in Mahbub’s face. Do you want any of these tostadas? I always order too many.</p><p>So Mahbub Asim returned to his life as a lubricious local chieftain. That life was full: there were never enough hours in the day for all his lechery, avarice, and vice. To circulate fully around his constituency, collecting money from various bands of crooks—for one favour or another, as consulting fees, sometimes simply because he was the big man in his district and he was owed his cut—and then distributing it to others. Sometimes to leave him alone, sometimes to do his will. Such sums of money poured through the Fleshpile’s hands every day, and it was his constant regret how little of it actually stuck. In the meantime, he needed to engineer a replacement for Detective Shiv Vaktashirana. Someone who would have to not only investigate the political morass around Baba Siddique, but also the political morass around the mysterious death of his predecessor. Someone who would be seen to investigate, but not <em>too</em> far. Who would conclude that Detective Vaktashirana—posthumously promoted, maybe—had been killed for his dogged investigation into the international network surrounding the Bishnoi gang, the greatest single internal threat to India’s safety and security… Mahbub didn’t relish what had to happen. Shiv had been a good and loyal client; in many ways, Mahbub had considered him a friend. But these are the sacrifices that must line the road to a free and independent Bombay, no longer one city in India but the sole centre of the world, no longer burdened by the a poor and backward country around it, no longer subsidising state-funded refuges for elderly cattle, but wealthy, modern, glittering, a place where someone like Mahbub Asim could get truly, truly <em>rich</em>… In any case, it transpired that Shiv’s deputy, a very promising young man named Vivek, was equally  distraught by the news of what would shortly be happening to his boss. Mahbub found that very touching. It was so rare to meet that kind of loyalty these days.</p><p>He didn’t see much point in informing young Vivek of what all these intrigues were actually <em>for</em>. No need to worry him with the great day that was coming, when the bankers and industrialists and property developers and, yes, the enterprising elements of the underworld would band together to seize the economic hub of India and unshackle it from the forces of backwardness that had kept the rest of the country in the mire. One day of tanks on the streets and enemies from the lampposts… All Vivek needed to know was that there was a cabal, which had infiltrated the police, the military, and every political party, and now it needed his help. Mahbub Asim could well imagine Vivek’s excitement; after all, he himself was undergoing a similar initiation. Heretofore he had been on the very lowest rung, had been the most insignificant cog in this machine, but not for long. Any moment now, his phone would ring, and he would be inducted into the mysteries that contain the wheels of life and death.</p><p>Dawn found the Fleshpile in a masjid he hadn’t visited in over a decade, forehead pressed hard to the floor, weeping, begging for a forgiveness he knew he wouldn’t deserve.</p><p>The call had come a few hours after midnight. The grey one’s voice was as friendly and even as ever. According to the Gospels, he said, the prophet Isa spoke in parables. Once, the disciples asked him why. He replied that the secret of God has been given to the disciples, but for everyone else he spoke in parables, so they would see but not perceive, and hear but not understand. Why did he do this? </p><p>I don’t know, said Mahbub.</p><p>No, said the grey one. Here is your truth. There is no cabal. There is no plot to seize Bombay and make it an independent corporatist city-state. The network you have built for us is for a completely different purpose. For the last twenty years you have been helping the muharibun li-llah. Now, you are no longer useful to us. There are things which you only partially understand. You will not hear from us again. If you attempt to find me, you will die.</p><p><em>Muharibun li-llah</em> means <em>those who make war against God</em>. Alongside the plummeting horror that swept down Mahbub’s body, he was left with a ghost of the smile, the small gentle smile that would have spread between the grey one’s round, chubby cheeks.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2e4c88a-6bae-43bd-b0d3-4af50cf9df8b_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2e4c88a-6bae-43bd-b0d3-4af50cf9df8b_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2e4c88a-6bae-43bd-b0d3-4af50cf9df8b_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2e4c88a-6bae-43bd-b0d3-4af50cf9df8b_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2e4c88a-6bae-43bd-b0d3-4af50cf9df8b_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2e4c88a-6bae-43bd-b0d3-4af50cf9df8b_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f2e4c88a-6bae-43bd-b0d3-4af50cf9df8b_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2426278,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2e4c88a-6bae-43bd-b0d3-4af50cf9df8b_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2e4c88a-6bae-43bd-b0d3-4af50cf9df8b_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2e4c88a-6bae-43bd-b0d3-4af50cf9df8b_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2e4c88a-6bae-43bd-b0d3-4af50cf9df8b_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The grey one’s name was Rishi Panwar, and like millions of Mumbaikars he took the train to work. Swaying gently with his face lodged between two foreign armpits. A hundred phones all blaring different YouTube videos at the same time. He got off at Grant Road, just in the shadow of Malabar Hill, along with a great plodding legion of doormen and waiters and cleaners and drivers and armed security guards, all trundling silently uphill to make the world effortless. Rishi had also come to serve. Tucked away behind a row of bungalows, just at the point where the gentle world touches the slums that mushroom on every patch of spare ground, even here, there was a tiny mandir. Fenced in red, hung with flags, and coiling smoke. The people in the bungalows and high-rises usually ignored the place and its half-savage rites, but some of the slum dwellers had come here from the north, the dusty and decaying world, and every so often they visited to thank the idol inside for everything they were glad not to know. Gifts of fire and flowers for the antelope-riding figure of Agyana, god of blissful ignorance.</p><p>Rishi shuffled out of his shoes at the gate. The pujari came bounding out of the temple to greet him. Rishi folded his hands and bowed. Good morning, guruji, he said. Muhuaarghahaagh, said the pujari. Like all priests of Agyana, he had entirely forgotten how to speak. He also didn’t know how to walk upright, but bounded about on his knuckles and toes, leaping up stairs, sliding on the polished stone. He wore a red loincloth and grease, and a white-flecked beard that reached just below his navel. Whatever name he’d once had was long gone. The priests of Agyana were nearly perfect in their ignorance. They understood nothing about the world or its politics. They forgot everything they once knew about the Vedas and the proper rites. Their lives were dedicated to a god, but not one of them could even pronounce his name. A Brahmin could achieve this through intense meditation and austerities, three or four decades spent narrowing the conscious attention to a single luminous point until even that finally disappears and the mind becomes pristine. But once that happens, the pujari becomes incapable of living without help. He needs an assistant: someone who can sacrifice their own ignorance for another’s. Someone whose religious role requires them to live in a nice but ordinary apartment with an Ikea sofa and a cat, and to order Mexican food on Swiggy, and to secretly control Mumbai’s mafias and also its police. To live in the penumbra, the half-world of partial understanding.</p><p>Rishi fed the temple antelope tied to its post and cleaned out the droppings it had left scattered on the marble floor. He cleaned the murti of Agyana and laid fresh flowers around its neck, while the priest whooped and gibbered around him. Finally he led the priest into the cement hut behind the temple and, after some coaxing, into the shower. He massaged shampoo into the priest’s thick mat of grey hair, while the holy man looked up at the streams of falling water in totally neutral incomprehension. After a few minutes he tried lapping up the water with his tongue. Rishi dressed the priest in a clean loincloth and rubbed talcum powder into his sagging flanks. Guhuuaar, said the priest. Rishi stroked his hair and chanted him ancient Agyana mantras, all of which were composed by the great gurus of distant generations and consisted of wordless, meaningless howls. It’s time for darshan now, he told the priest, whose eyes rolled wildly as he moaned. Rishi led him gently towards the door of the cement hut, and opened it to the sight of a gun pointed directly in his face. This morning, said Detective Shiv Vaktashirana, someone tried to murder me in my home. Do you know anything about that?</p><p>The last thing Rishi saw before the blindfold went on was the mad, frenzied gaze of the detective. This cop was unshaved, with yellowing sweat patches just visible under his cheap suit; he looked violently unhinged. Mahbub had been right; he really must have gone off the rails. With his sniggering, gurgling deputy in the front seat, the detective drove Rishi for maybe two hours through the honking, crawling Mumbai traffic. He wasn’t using the siren, Rishi noticed. When the blindfold came off, he was in another bare cement room. The mad detective was staring at him like a cat stares at a bird on the windowsill. Gun still in his hand, pointed directly between Rishi’s eyes. His deputy was leaning against the wall behind him. Let me guess, said the detective. If I’d tried to arrest you properly, bring you in to the station, I’d be dead right now. I wouldn’t be surprised, said Rishi. He stretched his legs out. I suppose you have some questions. I can tell you everything I know, if you like. It isn’t much. I only manage a small temple. There are huge complexes for Agyana in Rajasthan; that’s where my orders come from. But I’m the one who recruited Baba Siddique. He went willingly, you know. And the Englishman, the one in your cells… The detective grabbed the gun with both hands. Bas kar, he said. I don’t want to know. I don’t want to hear any of it. I’m not here to solve the bloody crime. But today two men came to my home and shot up the place, and if I didn’t know Mahbub’s black little heart I’d be in the morgue right now. I don’t want this. I’m here to negotiate. I’m here to tell you that whatever Mahbub said, I know <em>nothing</em>. I want to know <em>nothing</em>. So you tell me your price for leaving me alone, and whatever it is, I’ll pay it. And then we go our separate ways. </p><p>Rishi couldn’t help laughing. I think, he said, you would have made a very good devotee of my sect.</p><p>This is the secret of Agyana.</p><p>As all the sages know, there is one ultimate reality and one universal consciousness, which is Brahman, the true Self, the all-encompassing God spoken of in the Upanishads. And all the sages agree that God loves those who seek union with him. Once you attain perfect knowledge, you can transcend your individuality and melt back into the infinite. But if God wants us to become one with him, why did he make us individuals to begin with? Why does the universal consciousness keep playing this game in which it pretends to be separate people, Rishi Panwar and Mahbub Asim and Shiv Vaktashirana and Sam Kriss—and also, incidentally, you—all living and dying and being reborn again, cycling through life after life and never coming home? </p><p>The followers of Agyana conclude that God does not, in fact, want us to achieve union with the infinite mind. He likes his game. If we’re going to attain moksha, it will be against God’s will: we will have to make war against him. God tells us to follow the Krishna path: liberation through contemplation and perfect understanding. But understanding is hard, and very few people have ever achieved it; the more time passes, the more the Krishna path looks like a trap. Luckily, there’s another way: the Agyana path. In the Svetasvatara Upanishad, it is taught that ‘Two things are hidden in the mystery of infinity of Brahman: knowledge and ignorance. Ignorance passes away and knowledge is immortal; but Brahman is in Eternity above ignorance and knowledge.’ The Ishavasya Upanishad hails the Lord that is beyond knowing and unknowing. In the reality between all forms, these are exactly the same thing. The path through total incomprehension: that sounds more attainable. </p><p>All of us are trapped in this earthly reality by our partial awareness, the small flashes of partial understanding in which we’re polluted with the truth about the world and God. The great sages have tried to escape by purifying themselves of all understanding, but Rishi’s calling was different. He would suffer the burden of knowing many fragments of many secret things, all for the sake of spreading confusion across the earth. He would conjure strange and convoluted crimes, incomprehensible motives, incomprehensible methods, in a underworld so labyrinthine that not even its own inhabitants had any idea what was actually going on. Small deeds, but they would echo. In a hundred lifetimes of scheming and conspiracy, Rishi might help bring all conscious beings one second closer to liberation. Maybe that would be enough.</p><p>Unfortunately, Rishi told Detective Shiv Vaktashirana, I don’t know if I can offer you any kind of safety. Your death—it would draw a lot of attention to the Baba Siddique case, far more than it’s already received. One of the lead investigators, mysteriously murdered—it would be all over the newspapers, probably all over the world. You might not understand why, but this is exactly what my sect wants. Which means if someone did manage to kill you, there’s a network out there that’d make sure he’s very generously rewarded, and I can’t stop that. You already know half the police in this city work for us, even if they don’t know it. Your murderer would never see the inside of a jail cell. There would be a lot of money, and no risk at all, for a deed that’s already set in stone…</p><p>Shiv noticed that his prisoner was no longer looking him in the eyes. He seemed to be staring at the wall just behind him.</p><p>Vivek raised his gun and fired a single shot.</p>

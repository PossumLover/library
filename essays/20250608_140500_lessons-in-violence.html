The nefarious PROFESSOR SOPHISTICO has attacked the famous GOLDSCHMITT MANOR, fabulous home of MAYA GOLDSCHMITT, the city’s LEATHERIEST HEIRESS! The villain’s attack comes during a SWANKY SOIRÉE for investors in METZITZAH SYSTEMS, the high-tech Israeli arms manufacturer responsible for the BABYMASHER 3000, a loitering munition used to DEVASTATING EFFECT in maternity wards across the Gaza Strip! PROFESSOR SOPHISTICO, an adjunct in COMPARATIVE LITERATURE at the local university, has barricaded himself into the OPULENT BALLROOM at GOLDSCHMITT MANOR with five hostages! These are MAYA GOLDSCHMITT herself, billionaire playboy BRICK KOPF, local philanthropist RONNY LUFTMENSCH, beloved TV personality SUSAN PLAPEL, and OMER BALOG, the brilliant bald-headed boffin CTO of METZITZAH SYSTEMS! The devious PROFESSOR has wired his hostages with EXPLOSIVES—simply for the crime of BEING JEWISH! The bombs are attached to a DEAD MAN’S SWITCH, meaning that if the POLICE SNIPERS arranged around GOLDSCHMITT MANOR take a shot, all of SOPHISTICO’s hostages will POP LIKE WET CONFETTI! With no other recourse, the authorities have sent in the bumbling JIM PLAYNE, amateur hostage negotiator, to try to talk the CRAZED PROFESSOR down! Will PLAYNE manage to make a cogent case against INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE as a LEGITIMATE FORM OF RESISTANCE? Or will he himself end up being seduced by the MAD PROFESSOR’S DEMENTED IDEOLOGY? Read on to find out…</em></p><div><hr></div><p>PLAYNE: Nice barricades you’ve got here.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Thanks.</p><p>PLAYNE: You’ve put all these bits of wood together very precisely. It looks great. If I were Maya Goldschmitt I’d keep them up afterwards.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I watch Japanese woodworking on TikTok. It’s relaxing.</p><p>PLAYNE: Yeah?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: It’s called sashimono. They do joinery without any nails or glue. It all rests on these highly complex joints carved using simple chisels called nomi. I can show you some videos if you like.</p><p>PLAYNE: That’d be—maybe afterwards? You’ve also—it looks like you’ve taken a couple of hostages here.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I’m striking back against the machinery of death.</p><p>HOSTAGES: [<em>Indistinct panicked mumbling through their gags</em>]</p><p>PLAYNE: And how are we feeling about this? Any, you know, regrets?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Pretty good, to be honest. </p><p>PLAYNE: Alright. Mind walking me through how we got here?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Well, basically how it started was that I couldn’t sleep. Every day, I watch videos of what’s happening in Gaza. The most horrible, horrible stuff. The other day I saw a father holding up half of his daughter. Half of a little girl. An Israeli bomb had exploded inside their house and it just cut her body in half. She’d never hurt anyone. Or there’s videos of babies, crying babies with exposed ribcages. They don’t understand why they can’t have any food. Every day it’s like this. There’s been an airstrike on a school. There’s been a team of medics shot one by one and buried in a mass grave. They’ve gunned down dozens of hungry people trying to get food. They targeted the home of a paediatrician and killed nine of her children. Kids she loved and cared for all their lives, and Israel wiped them all out in an instant. For no reason. So I see all of this happening, and then I can’t sleep. I keep lying in bed, thinking about it, until it’s five, six in the morning. How am I supposed to sleep in my warm bed, in my safe home, while <em>this</em> is happening to my fellow human beings? How can anyone just go about their normal lives when we’re watching a live-streamed genocide, twenty-four hours a day? I think the reason I couldn’t sleep was my conscience. It was telling me I had a duty to do something. So this is me doing something.</p><p>PLAYNE: You watch snuff films before bed and then you can’t sleep.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Yeah. Do you think I should just <em>ignore</em> it? Pretend it isn’t happening? Wall myself off?</p><p>PLAYNE: No, no. Just saying. Let’s go back. You said you had a duty to do something. But there’s lots of ways of doing something. You could have, you know, marched—</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Ha. Of course they’d send a lib. Look, imagine this. Imagine it isn’t Gaza. Let’s say I’m right here, going into people’s houses with a gun—</p><p>PLAYNE: Well, you <em>are</em> right here, going into people’s houses with a gun.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Let me finish. Imagine I go into your house at night and [<em>making gun fingers</em>] bang, I murder your wife. Bang, murder your son. While they’re sleeping. Then I take out a saw and <em>cut your daughter in half</em>. Next night, I do it again, to your neighbour. And the next night, and the night after that, for nearly two years, and the police do absolutely nothing to stop me. In fact, they’re supplying me with ammunition. And then in the daytime, they let me go on the TV and explain that I had to do it because those kids made me feel unsafe, and by the way I’m the most moral man in town, and if you have any problem with me breaking into houses and wiping out families, you’re some kind of <em>bigot</em>. I keep getting away with it, and I keep killing. What would you do in that situation? Do you think you’d sleep well at night? Would you choose non-violence? Would you go on a protest march against me? Write a letter to the Mayor? Fight against hatred with the power of love? Or would you do whatever it took to stop me before I killed again? </p><p>PLAYNE: I’m not sure it’s the same.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: No. Because in my thought experiment it’s happening <em>here</em>, and in reality it’s happening somewhere else. A lot of people just don’t view Palestinians as fully human. When <em>their</em> children are cut in half it doesn’t matter. But I refuse to care less about someone’s life just because they live far away.</p><p>PLAYNE: I guess what I meant is that, like I said, you really are going into people’s houses with a gun. You say you’re so horrified by violence, but here you are, committing acts of violence.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: OK, now we’re getting into it. You’re against violence? All violence?</p><p>PLAYNE: Yes. I think so.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: But right now there’s snipers pointing guns at me through the window. I don’t think you <em>want</em> them to take me out, I’m sure you’d prefer it if everyone could leave this room alive. But if they shot me in the middle of an active hostage situation, I don’t think you’d be morally outraged. So there’s clearly some violence you’re willing to accept and some violence you’re not. </p><p>PLAYNE: That’s true.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: So what’s the difference between acceptable and unacceptable violence?</p><p>PLAYNE: Well, the police, they’ve got legal authority—</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Exactly. Their violence is <em>legitimate</em>. It comes from the state. The state can send people to prison, but when I keep people in a room against their will it’s hostage-taking. If the state thinks parents are doing a bad job, it can kidnap their children; I can’t. And Israel is a state, an internationally recognised sovereign power, which is why it’s allowed to cut little girls in half, and private citizens are not. But there is such a thing in international law as the <em>right to resist</em>. Did you know that? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that we ‘have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression.’ So illegitimate individual violence is actually <em>legitimate</em> under the law. The distinction contradicts itself. So what else? How else do you tell the difference between acceptable and unacceptable violence?</p><p>PLAYNE: I don’t know.</p><p>HOSTAGES: [<em>Muffled sounds of alarm getting louder</em>]</p><p>PLAYNE: But look, the police wouldn’t be here if you hadn’t walked into a party full of people and started pointing guns at them. We’re trying to put an <em>end</em> to violence. That’s just not the same as deliberately starting it. </p><p>SOPHISTICO: Sure.</p><p>PLAYNE: So why don’t we try, maybe, letting one of the hostages—</p><p>SOPHISTICO: But I didn’t initiate the violence here. Every single one of these people is an investor in Metzitzah Systems. They are all <em>making money</em> out of a campaign of mass slaughter being waged on the other side of the world. I’m just responding. The violence is already taking place, and I’m the one trying to end it. Similarly, the violence on October 7th was a response to decades of illegal blockade, occupation, and colonisation against the people of Palestine. The distinction between initiating violence and responding with violence also doesn’t hold. There’s always a precedent. </p><p>PLAYNE: So why don’t you support the war then?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: What do you mean?</p><p>PLAYNE: You say this violence is justified by a previous act of violence. So doesn’t that apply to Israeli violence as well? How do <em>you</em> tell the difference between good and bad violence?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I was getting there.</p><p>PLAYNE: Go on, then.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Acceptable violence is the violence that liberates the oppressed from their oppression. Liberals like you only accept violence when it’s ‘legitimate,’ in other words, when it’s used by the established order to crush and pacify the powerless. I’m the opposite. </p><p>PLAYNE: Right.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Good, isn’t it?</p><p>PLAYNE: I’m thinking about it. I worry it might have some holes.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Like what?</p><p>PLAYNE: I mean, do you really think that’s what you’re doing? Liberating the oppressed from their oppression?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I’m trying.</p><p>PLAYNE: I don’t know if I buy it. If you were really serious about liberating the oppressed, you wouldn’t be taking hostages and hooking them up to explosives. Let’s say our conversation here ends badly, and you blow up all these people here—</p><p>HOSTAGES: [<em>Squirming in panic</em>]</p><p>PLAYNE: —what do you think happens next? Let me tell you. Everyone you hate—<em>they</em> get to be the victim now. You’ve just given them a big gory piece of evidence that <em>they’re</em> the oppressed, not you, which means <em>their</em> violence is justified, not yours. These categories are more malleable than you think. And a lot of people will start agreeing with them, because most people don’t want to be on the same side as a crazy killer. So everyone who’s been trying to do the serious work of advocating for Palestine now has to deal with the PR nightmare another violent extremist in their ranks. There are reams of evidence that this kind of violent action is almost always counterproductive. Plus, just like you said, every violent act provokes a violent response. How do you think the Israelis will respond to this? Will they bomb Gaza <em>less</em>? Do you really think this will put a <em>stop</em> to the cycle of violence? It seems to me that all you’ve done is snuffed out five human lives forever, and made things <em>worse</em> for the people you claim to care about in the process. And yourself, of course. You’re Merry Levov, blowing up a post office. Pointless waste.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I see. So now you don’t think violence is <em>bad</em>. It’s just <em>ineffective</em>.</p><p>PLAYNE: Look, man, I’m a hostage negotiator. I’m just trying to get you to let these people go. If I can sell you on violence being bad, I’ll say that. If I can sell you on violence being ineffective, that works too. If I thought I could convince you that the established order isn’t so awful, I’d give it a shot.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: It’s difficult to have an honest discussion with someone who doesn’t really believe in anything.</p><p>PLAYNE: Does it matter what I believe? I just accept whatever’s been convincingly demonstrated to me. You should try it. You know I’m right.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: No. You’re not. Imagine this. It’s World War Two and your country is occupied by the Nazis. They’re carting away all the Jews and Roma to concentration camps. You watch it happen every day. Now, if you want, you can run away into the hills and join up with the partisans. Fight the Nazis. But the Nazis have a reprisals policy. For every one of their soldiers that the partisans kill, they will go into a village, line up ten civilians against a wall, and shoot them. So should you resist the Nazis? Maybe on your utilitarian calculus it doesn’t help, maybe it’s even actively harmful. But don’t you have a duty? When you’re facing such a brutal machinery of death, aren’t you personally obliged to throw absolutely everything you have against it, even your own body, to strike back just for a moment, to make sure that these people suffer just a little for what they’ve done, so there’s some kind of price for their actions, even if it’s ultimately futile, even if it doesn’t help, just so you didn’t stand by and let it happen? What would you do? Would you resist, or not?</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>PLAYNE: I don’t know. </p><p>SOPHISTICO: You wouldn’t?</p><p>PLAYNE: I said I don’t know. </p><p>SOPHISTICO: I would. I wouldn’t hesitate for an instant.</p><p>PLAYNE: I can see that.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Maybe you’d have been one of the Nazis. </p><p>PLAYNE: Maybe I don’t care so much about my own personal moral status.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: You’re trying to make wanting to be a good person seem like a bad thing.</p><p>PLAYNE: It might be. Look: before, you said that violence is justified when it liberates the oppressed. Now, you’re saying that it doesn’t even need to actually <em>do</em> anything. It can even actively make things worse! You just need to be <em>thinking</em> the right kind of thoughts when you do it.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Kant said that the only thing that can be said to be good without qualification is a good will.</p><p>PLAYNE: Take many hostages, did he, Kant? </p><p>SOPHISTICO: [<em>Brandishing the trigger</em>] Careful.</p><p>BELOVED TV PERSONALITY SUSAN PLAPEL: [<em>Spitting out her gag</em>] Fuck’s sake, idiot, don’t antagonise him.</p><p>PLAYNE: But it’s a reasonable point, isn’t it? What you’ve just outlined is a system in which literally any action, however pointless or destructive, can be justified, so long as it’s in the name of the oppressed. Maybe I start, I dunno, stamping on kittens in the name of the oppressed. Maybe I’m a sicko who <em>likes</em> stamping on kittens, but as long as I say I’m doing it to fight oppression then you have to go along with it. Not just that: anyone in the movement who tries to argue <em>against</em> stamping on kittens looks like a mushy liberal. Or worse, if you object to the kitten-stamping you must be on the side of the oppressor. Look, is there <em>anything</em> at all the resistance could do that would make you say no, stop, you’ve gone too far? </p><p>SOPHISTICO: [<em>Idly putting the duct tape back over BELOVED TV PERSONALITY SUSAN PLAPEL’s mouth</em>] You’re speaking in hypotheticals. You’re asking me to condemn some notional future act of extreme violence from the pro-Palestinian side, even while Palestinians are <em>actually</em> being subjected to extreme genocidal violence, in real life, right now. What about that? Why does your moral test only apply to one side? Why don’t you ask these people instead? [<em>Rips off the duct tape again</em>] Hey, Susan, is there anything the IDF could do that would make you stop supporting them? </p><p>BELOVED TV PERSONALITY SUSAN PLAPEL: You know, I’ve always believed in peace. I’ve always—</p><p>SOPHISTICO: [<em>Gagging her again</em>] She’ll say anything. Let’s open another. [<em>Briefly releasing the BRILLIANT BALD-HEADED BOFFIN OMER BALOG</em>] What do you think? </p><p>BRILLIANT BALD-HEADED BOFFIN OMER BALOG: Fuck you, antisemite.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: There we go. Ladies and gentlemen, the level of discourse.</p><p>PLAYNE: But so what? Israel and its supporters have entered a moral and intellectual abyss. Sure. We’re not talking about them, though. We’re talking about you. What you’ve been saying is that if there’s an ongoing genocide, and other countries aren’t doing anything to stop it, that means individuals like you have a particular duty to act. Is that right?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Pretty much.</p><p>PLAYNE: I assume you’ve heard of Tigray.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Oh, fuck off.</p><p>PLAYNE: What?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: You know, for a moment I thought you were better than this. I know exactly where you’re going here. Other bad things are happening in the world, so why are you singling out Israel? Why aren’t you on the streets for Sudan and Congo? And then, just like Omer over here, you suggest it’s because I have a problem with Jews. It’s funny, Israel apologists never seem to care about any of these other issues until they need to deflect from their own crimes. Maybe people should try it in court. Your honour, why are you singling <em>me</em> out for murdering <em>one</em> person, when there’s a civil war in Sudan? </p><p>PLAYNE: That’s not where I’m going.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I’m not sure I believe you.</p><p>PLAYNE: I’m just asking. Do you know what happened there, only a few years ago? There’s a city called Adigrat in the north of Tigray. It was captured by the Eritreans on the day of a religious festival. They mowed down hundreds of people worshipping in a church. They went from door to door, dragging random people out of their homes and executing them on the spot. Pregnant women. Afterwards, they let the survivors bury the dead, but warned that anyone visibly mourning would be shot. Ethiopia and Eritrea did this in practically every town and city they captured. Mass rape too, something like a hundred thousand women raped. And then famine. They devastated the countryside, blocked all food aid coming into Tigray, and so masses and masses of people starved to death. Meanwhile Ethiopian officials kept saying that Tigrayans are weeds, they should be wiped out for a hundred years. It was a genocide. I don’t know the exact numbers off my head, but certainly in the same ballpark as Gaza. I know other people bring it up as a gotcha, but I’m really asking. Why do you care so much about Gaza, but not Tigray?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: You don’t know that. I do care. I retweeted—</p><p>PLAYNE: Did it keep you up at night? Was it impossible to live a normal life? Did you feel like you had no moral choice other than to bring a bomb to an Ethiopian investors’ party?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: But <em>what</em> Ethiopian party? There weren’t any! Everything you’ve described is horrible, absolutely. But what’s happening in Gaza is being supported by <em>my</em> government. <em>My</em> taxes are paying for this genocide. My TV is full of hasbara. My local grandees are holding fundraising parties to keep the death machine running. If you speak out against it you’re labelled a racist. Gaza is the frontline in the global struggle between colonialism and resistance. Gaza is where the sharp end of empire is driven into the earth. It’s where the world resolves into black and white. Is it really surprising that I’m angrier about Gaza than Tigray?</p><p>PLAYNE: No. Of course not. You’re right.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Thank you.</p><p>PLAYNE: But that’s not what you said at the start. You said that a life in Gaza was the moral equivalent of a life here, and if people care less about Gaza it’s because they don’t see Palestinians as fully human. So: do you not see Tigrayans as fully human? Is it their <em>fault</em> that they’re not on the frontline of the global struggle between colonialism and resistance? I think you’re not being fully honest about your motivations.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: What do you mean?</p><p>PLAYNE: You know, Professor Sophistico, I did see your psych evaluation before I came in here. You teach a class called ‘Vegetal Metaphors’ on fruit, vegetables, and the colonial imaginary in European fiction, 1860-1945. You live alone. You have not had a girlfriend since before the pandemic. Your main activity, outside the seminar room, is posting online. You stay at home on weekends and look at your phone. You have made over three hundred thousand tweets. In one of them, you say that if you hadn’t found the right podcasts in your late teens, you might have ended up as a neo-Nazi instead of a Marxist-Leninist. In another, you say that everyone who did become a neo-Nazi should be rounded up and shot. You’re on Lexapro for generalised anxiety disorder. I think this is why you care more about Gaza than Tigray. It’s just like you said: what’s happening in Gaza indicts the whole society around you. And you’re right! We really are all complicit. Which means you now have a clear moral justification for hating everything. Your ordinary unhappiness becomes a deep moral insight. Your failure to live well becomes a badge of honour. Anyone who <em>is</em> happy in this world must be morally deficient. Tigray is just some Africans killing each other for reasons you don’t really understand. But Gaza is all about <em>you</em>.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: That’s not fair.</p><p>PLAYNE: But isn’t this what you’ve been saying all along? You’ve said that you don’t want to be the person who sat back and did nothing. You want to act. You’ve ruled out every single constraint except your own feelings. You said it doesn’t matter if doing this helps absolutely no one, or even if it makes things worse. You refused to accept any moral limits. All that matters is that <em>you</em> feel like you’re—what was it?—striking back against the engine of death. And what happens once it’s done? People won’t be able to keep the focus on Gaza, where, as you point out, kids are being killed every day. They’ll have to talk about <em>you</em>. Explaining, or justifying, or denouncing <em>your</em> actions. Isn’t that why you’re really here?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: You think, what, everyone who cares about Palestine is really just a massive loser?</p><p>PLAYNE: No. Of course not. Just the people who make a fetish out of violence. Just the people who care more about their right to commit violence than anything else. But look—you can prove me wrong, very easily. All you have to do is hand over that trigger.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Why would I do that?</p><p>PLAYNE: Think about it. If you want to keep hold of the trigger, it means your motivations really are personal and psychological, rather than ethical and political. What matters to you most of all is that <em>you</em> get to have your revenge on the world. But if your motivations <em>are</em> ethical and political, you’ll hand it over. It won’t matter to you if this particular action is successful or not. You’re not attached to violence for its own sake. You’re willing to sacrifice the consolations of violence, if necessary, for a greater cause. Giving me the trigger proves that everything you’ve said is right, and everything I’ve said is wrong.</p><p>[<em>A very long pause.</em>]</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I could blow them all up right now, you know.</p><p>PLAYNE: I know.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I’d barely even have to think about it.

They tackle SOPHISTICO to the floor, lightly pulverise him with batons, and drag him away. For a moment, JIM PLAYNE is alone with the five kneeling hostages, holding the trigger. He exhales, very slowly. He’s done it. It’s over. The hostages are safe. He’s won. PLAYNE starts walking over to the nearest hostage, who happens to be BILLIONAIRE PLAYBOY BRICK KOPF. Suddenly he stops. The muscles in his jaw pulse, as he thinks over the implications of the wager he’s just made with the devious PROFESSOR SOPHISTICO.</em>]</p><p>PLAYNE: Ah, fuck.</p><p>[<em>His finger twitches on the button.</em>]</p>

Ever since it was established in 1946, CHAP(TAH) has played a vital role in public discourse. During the 1957 Suez Crisis, when Anthony Eden described Nasser as a ‘Mussolini on the Nile,’ CHAP(TAH) bravely suggested that the president of Egypt was actually more like the renegade Mamluk Ali Bey al-Kabir, or Ahmose I, who expelled the Hyskos and nationalised the pyramids. Over the course of the Cold War, CHAP(TAH) observed a worrying tendency to bracket Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union together as ‘twin totalitarianisms,’ fundamentally similar in their rejection of the liberal-democratic project. Guided by its founding principles of Nilf and Finlap—that Nothing Is Like Fascism, and Fascism Is Not Like Anything in Particular—CHAP(TAH) proposed that behind its ideological mask, the Soviet Union was actually a continuation of the Golden Horde, a cruel Mongolic steppe-power piling up peasants’ skulls just as it had done ever since 1237. When the Symbionese Liberation Army screamed ‘Death to the fascist insect,’ CHAP(TAH) suggested that maybe it was just an ordinary bourgeois insect after all. And after 9/11, when the term ‘Islamofascism’ entered mainstream popular usage, CHAP(TAH) issued a flurry of white papers pointing out that there’s a much better word for a small cadre of fanatics trying to enact major social change through spectacular acts of criminal violence, and begged the Bush administration to declare war on Islamoblanquism. </em></p><p><em>Today, CHAP(TAH)’s interventions are more crucial than ever. The second Trump administration has been in place for slightly over two months, and a lot has happened in that time. The President of the United States is hawking cars from the White House lawn. A gang of brainrotted teenagers, named after a lame internet meme, has been permitted to shut down a programme that prevents babies from dying of AIDS. They’ve done this for no obvious reason. The US has imposed stringent tariffs on its largest trading partners, again for no obvious reason. Trump keeps threatening to annex Canada; meanwhile a campaign of cultural terror against any form of moral or sexual degeneracy is already underway. Students who have the wrong opinions about a conflict on another continent are taken away in chains; government cronies keep performing straight-arm salutes. These are chaotic times, but while the future is uncertain, the past is reassuringly set in stone. No wonder, then, that people are increasingly seeking the comfort and certainty of historical analogy. It’s good to know that we are not lost in the world, plunging into empty time; it’s good to know that everything that happens is the same as something that already happened a long time ago. Unfortunately, the only thing everyone can reliably remember having happened is the Third Reich.</em></p><p><em>The following roundtable discussion is an attempt to seek out alternatives to the Nazi metaphor. It takes place in a hot air balloon floating high above Washington, DC. Seven frothing maniacs from both sides of the political aisle have been invited to make their case for why the present year is actually just an echo of another age, with the proviso that the other age can’t be any time between 1923 and 1945. The panellists are as follows:</em></p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Aculina Splaj</strong>, Moldova’s second least miserable essayist, argues that we’re in <strong>1991</strong></em></p></li><li><p><em><strong>Michael Leaks</strong>, who’s changed his political ideology so often it now sometimes happens midway through a sentence, argues that we’re in <strong>1961</strong></em></p></li><li><p><em><strong>Koventreigh DiFino</strong>, who has a hole the exact shape of her phone screen burned into the front of her brain, argues that we’re in <strong>1799</strong></em></p></li><li><p><em><strong>Blurtis Bongo,</strong> a leather jacket that claims to have achieved sentience, argues that we’re in <strong>1530</strong></em></p></li><li><p><em><strong>Lugubrious Wen</strong>, who lives in the swamps, argues that we’re in <strong>1436</strong></em></p></li><li><p><em><strong>Eric Schlob</strong>, who knows all the swearwords, argues that we’re in <strong>like 50 or something</strong></em></p></li><li><p><em><strong>A mysterious, hooded stranger</strong> argues that we’re in <strong>20,000</strong></em></p></li></ul><p><em>The rules of the discussion are simple. Each participant has five minutes to make their case.

In May 1991, the Soviet cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev flies to the space station Mir. He looks down on the beautiful marble of the Earth. Wow, he says, from up here you can’t see any countries or borders, all the world is one. Meanwhile, down on that glassy surface, a fat man named Boris Yeltsin climbs on top of a tank. It’s not so far as climbing into orbit, but when he gets up there countries really do disappear. Sergei Krikalev can’t see it, but down on Earth the country that sent him into space no longer exists. All the oilfields and factories that once belonged to the Soviet people now belong to a few oligarchs. Russia no longer dreams about extending the hand of brotherhood into outer space; all anyone cares about is getting rich. In the new Russia either you get rich or you starve. And meanwhile poor Sergei is trapped in his space station, wheeling around the world every hour and a half, unable to get back down, and with no one coming to fetch him. The command centre where they sent him up is a McDonald’s now. Three hundred days he floats, and when he’s finally brought back down it’s like arriving on an entirely different planet to the one he’d left.</p><p>I say this because only recently, two American astronauts, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, have arrived back to our planet after an eight-day mission that lasted more than nine months. They were stuck up there. The great American superpower could not bring them down. But it has been busy in the meantime. Williams and Wilmore are also returning to a different world.</p><p>For those of us who grew up in Europe in the 1990s, it feels very familiar. This is what happens when a superpower collapses. Here you have your tycoons hollowing out the country, firing state employees en masse, mothballing entire government departments. Elon Musk ensured that your meteorological department no longer has the funds to send up weather balloons or track hurricanes. The geological survey can no longer monitor volcanoes. We are helpless again before the powers of nature, the winds that will blow through our houses… Next the government announces it will set up a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. Why? Because the cronies of the new regime have a lot of money in crypto. Howard Lutnick owns maybe a billion dollars worth. He is also the Secretary of Commerce. Taxpayer money will go to pumping up the value of his assets. Meanwhile it is now legal to pump mercury into the sky, put poison in the rivers. Extract every last shred of wealth from this ruined land, and put it all in digital currencies that never touch the filth.</p><p>But what is most familiar from the days after the fall of Soviet Union is not even this or that action from hoodlums in power, but the mood. For an entire lifetime, every Soviet citizen was required by the state to believe in the liberation and brotherhood of all humanity, even while the whole country slowly collapsed… What a relief not to have to believe any more! What a liberation to believe in nothing! Now America is the same. For a quarter of a millennium you had to pay lip service to liberty, equality, the Rights of Man, a more perfect union, and now—gone. The President is selling shitcoins. Perhaps it was always a scam, but now it no longer pretends to be anything else. The proper state-approved attitude is to meet the world with a sneer and a calloused heart. Here there is no resemblance at all to fascism. The fascists told young men to suffer and sacrifice for the nation with earnest spirits. An evil ideology, to be certain, but—</p><p><em>(At this point Aculina Splaj is drowned out by voices shrieking: Finlap! Finlap! Two other participants rush towards her. The basket of the hot air balloon wobbles horribly as they slam Aculina Splaj against the side and finally tip her over the top. Wait, she pleads, I hadn’t finished. But she has; she’s finished. Down she goes.)</em></p><h4>Michael Leaks: The case for 1961</h4><p>Comrades—now the hysterical lib is out of here, maybe we can talk seriously. </p><p>Ms spaj gave us a very pretty argument based on vibes and moods. I’m not going to do that. I’m going to deliver a materialist analysis rooted in the actual policies of the second Trump administration. And when you look at the policy, you realise that there’s nothing very unusual about Donald Trump at all. You don’t need to go reaching into distant centuries: his politics are the politics that used to dominate three-quarters of the globe. Donald Trump is following the economic and geopolitical agenda of the Non-Aligned Movement. The spirit of the 1961 Belgrade Conference is alive in Washington DC.</p><p>It’s very amusing to hear the panicked clucking of the economic establishment whenever Trump announces a new set of tariffs. Every time they cry: you can’t put up tariffs for <em>no reason</em>! Some midwit even managed to say it at the top of this post. But of course the working classes have always understood that you don’t need a reason. What Trump is pursuing is ordinary <em>developmentalism</em>, of the type that dominated every Third World economy in the mid-twentieth century. Under a colonial economy, the Third World exports raw materials to be processed abroad; developmentalism proposes that the exploited countries can only build prosperity through an endogenous process of capital accumulation, rather than participation in global markets. The mechanism is import substitution. The state artificially improves the competitiveness of domestic products within the local market. Sometimes you can do this with tariffs and subsidies, sometimes you need an atmosphere of terror and the revolutionary masses in arms to scare off foreign capital. </p><p>This is exactly what America needs. Right now the US is a huge market, but it’s being flooded with cheap imports from the industrial giants over our northern and southern borders. We run extraordinary current account deficits to sustain low capital costs for foreign manufacturers. If we’re ever going to stand on our own two feet, that needs to end. Currently, the US production of pig iron is less than one-twentieth of China’s. With heavy tariffs and a population mobilised against foreign subversives, that can change. We can begin to produce significant quantities of wood pulp. Set quotas for bauxite. One day, we might even have the capacity to domestically manufacture an iPhone.</p><p>The <em>second</em> plank of the Belgrade agenda is anti-imperialism. I feel confident in saying that the most successful anti-imperialist in human history is Donald Trump. Look at what he’s already done. His signature achievement since taking office has been the immolation of USAID, and USAID is, as everyone knows, the soft-power wing of the CIA. This is the agency that specialises in sowing propaganda around the world, co-opting civil society in every country on Earth, and keeping the imperialists in charge of the planet’s natural, industrial, and intellectual resources, all under the cover of humanitarian aid. Donald Trump wiped out its funding. Before long he may well do the same to NATO, the neo-colonial gang that’s bombed a crescent of destruction into the world from Belgrade to Tripoli. The American military bases that dot the world might be packed up and shipped home. Trump has been very explicit in his vision. No more security umbrella for western Europe or the comprador regimes of the Pacific. A world of genuinely independent states, each taking responsibility for their own path, coexisting through a dense web of luxury hotels and real-estate deals.</p><p>I suppose you could object that in promoting development economics, Trump is moving his country <em>down</em> the value chain rather than up. Some pedants might point out that the global empire he’s so heroically standing up against is, in fact, his own empire. I don’t find this particularly important. What matters is that Trumpism is a Third World politics. In fact, <em>all</em> the aspects of his governing style that upset the establishment so much—the nationalist grandstanding, the sabre-rattling against neighbouring states, the ethnic tension, the general indifference to certain liberal rights—were always common among national liberation movements. The tenor of politics among the global majority—</p><p><em>(A strange shadow seems to fall over Michael Leaks’ face. His mouth keeps moving for a moment, in circular motions like a cow chewing the cud. His eyes are open but pointed at nothing in particular. Third World politics, he repeats emptily as the new ideology slowly percolates through his brain. Third World politics. Suddenly he shouts.) </em></p><p>Third World politics! Donald Trump has brought Third World politics to our country! A big fat strongman surrounded by his sycophants! A criminal! Trying to overturn elections! Bickering with the neighbours over naming rights to bodies of water! Tinpot strongman! We’ve become a banana republic, ruled by an American caudillo! No wonder all the Latinos voted for him! We let the Third World in, and now look what’s happened! If <em>only</em> he were a fascist! At least those guys had some <em>class</em>! At least Adolf Hitler was a civilised European man! Donald Trump is just a goddamn—</p><p><em>(His eyes are still looking at nothing, but his arms twitch like live wires. As he shouts he throws his body around, bouncing off the other participants, until one great spasm carries him out of the basket of the hot air balloon and plummeting down, with the racial slur dopplering through the sky behind him.)</em></p><h4>Koventreigh DiFino: The case for 1799</h4><p>OK so Trump is Napoleon. That’s about it really. I have, like, no idea what those two were even saying? Trump is Napoleon, the woke left are the Jacobins because duh, Biden is the Directory, it all lines up. So now we’re in the Consulate, but I guess we’ve got like four years until the end of his term and then he puts the crown on his own head and becomes Emperor? Sorry but this is all actually really obvious. There are certain figures who recur endlessly throughout history, like a single soul fated to repeat itself again and again, leading an infinite number of lives with exactly the same shape? Perhaps what we think of as time doesn’t exist, and where we see multiple individuals God sees only one, refracted in the crystal structure of His creation? Like I know for a fact that I was Simone Weil, I was Julian of Norwich, I was Hypatia, because I’m five foot four and like <em>super</em> skinny. So in the same way times of chaos and civil strife will call forth the man of pure will? Whose ultimate fate is always defeat and death but who strikes the world like lightning while he lives? Trump is totally Napoleon, Trump is Caesar, Trump is, like, I know we’re not supposed to talk about him, but there’s, like, oh no, Hitler, frowny face, but then there’s also like, maybe, you know, hey, Hitler? </p><p><em>(Koventreigh DiFino does not resist as she’s bundled off the hot air balloon. It happens almost instantly. One moment she’s pouting guilelessly; the next her form falls into the thick bank of clouds until it’s just a black dot that crumples invisibly to earth.)</em></p><h4>Blurtis Bongo: The case for 1530</h4><p>So uh. We have heard from some of the <em>detractors</em> of the new regime. Apparently Trump is <em>hollowing out</em> the country. Apparently he’s turning it into a <em>third world hellhole</em>. Apparently the entire project is <em>doomed</em>. I have some questions. Like—is the new regime <em>actually</em> hollowing out the country? Ripping out great <em>globs</em> of it? Is it taking an <em>ice-cream scoop</em> to our beloved USG? Or is it hollowing it out with a <em>teaspoon</em>? Are we looking at the action of a <em>parasitic worm</em>, or a <em>colonic irrigation</em>? If only there were some way to find out…</p><p>What we need is an <em>unbiased view</em>. Someone who has <em>no stakes</em> in our current, uh, debate. Is Trump Napoleon? Is he Hitler? Is he, perhaps, <em>Yegor Gaidar</em>? Our respondent has <em>no clue</em>. He’s never heard of <em>any</em> of these people. Since all of <em>you</em> have heard of Hitler, you’re sadly disqualified. <em>I</em> have heard of the entire Nazi cabinet—I have <em>no</em> chance. But how about someone from the year <em>1530</em>? </p><p>The priorities of the year 1530 are <em>alien</em>, but not <em>unknowable</em>. Our present has a hard time intuiting them, but our present is, like, totally <em>retarded</em>. Luckily, the detritus of <em>less </em>retarded eras still litters the world. You can access <em>forbidden knowledge</em>. You can go on Google Books and read all 7,000 pages of James Anthony Froude’s twelve-volume 1862 <em>History of England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Death of Elizabeth</em>, for <em>free</em>. Have <em>I</em> read it? Unimportant. <em>You</em> haven’t. What our friend Froude reveals is that for the people of 1530, the proper functions of state somehow <em>failed to include</em> such important tasks as promoting the development of local industry, retrieving astronauts, or achieving the liberation of all humanity. Even <em>liberty</em>, <em>equality</em>, and <em>the Rights of Man</em> are mysteriously absent. But is the world of 1530 so different from ours? Not so! They faced the same problems that bedevil you in, uh, 2025. The difference is that they expected their government to <em>solve</em> those problems. From the perspective of 1530, the main function of the state is to <em>kill the homeless</em>. </p><p>I’m not kidding. The 1530 Vagabonds Act declares that if anyone is found ‘wandering in Idleness, or doth not apply to his Labour, or is not in Service with any Master, he shall be adjudged and executed.’ What monsters these people must have been! Unless—</p><p>Froude says different. Listen: ‘It was the expressed conviction of the English nation, that it was better for a man not to live at all than to live a profitless and worthless life. In point of justice as well as of prudence, it harmonised with the iron temper of the age, and it answered well for the government of a fierce and powerful people, in whose hearts lay an intense hatred of rascality, and among whom no one need have lapsed into evil courses except by deliberate preference for them.’</p><p>An <em>intense hatred of rascality</em>. To a modern liberal, nothing is more shocking. But then what is liberalism but <em>organised rascality</em>? <em>Better for a man not to live at all than to live a profitless and worthless life</em>. Ouch! To our liberal, this is <em>Nazi shit</em>. But were there already Nazis in 1530? Is <em>all of history</em> Nazi? Much to think about…</p><p>What is happening today is a <em>regression to the historical mean</em>. We are <em>snapping out</em> of the brief daydream called liberalism and returning to what everyone until <em>yesterday</em> agreed were the ordinary, uh, principles of government. This is not a <em>historical analogy</em>—there is literally <em>no such thing</em> as the year 2025. There is just an eternal 1530—which was, after all, here <em>first</em>. You are not a <em>citizen</em>—you are a <em>peasant</em>. You will <em>thresh corn</em> with a <em>flail</em>. We are going to give you <em>bubonic plague</em>. And yes, we are going to kill all the homeless—in fact, <em>everyone</em> who represents a net <em>expenditure</em> on our national balance sheets rather than an <em>asset</em>. Since the problem of People of Net Expenditure has <em>metastasised</em> since 1530, some new <em>methods</em> will be required. We might need <em>camps</em>. We might have to use <em>chambers</em>. Chemistry has made some <em>exciting advances</em> in the last eighty years—</p><p><em>(It’s been enough for a while now, but at this point Eric Schlob snatches hold of Blurtis Bongo and throws him out of the balloon.

That also goes for all the shitfuckery we’ve seen in this balloon so far. Astronauts? Import subsitution? Threshing? I literally could not understand a single word that last guy even said. Are you clownfucks making sense? Nope. Do I know a single shitfuckshitfucking thing about history? Also nope. But I do know about our so-called ‘President,’ Fuckface Donny ‘Lil’ Hands.’ </p><p>You want a historical analogy? Fine. Lil’ Hands is a syphilitic Roman Emperor. Call him Orange Julius. Let’s run down the checklist, shall we? Nepotistic failson? Check. Worshipped as a living god by his shit-for-brains followers? Check. Lives in a gaudy golden palace? Check. Huge pointless building projects to compensate for his tiny dingdong? Check. Promoting dumb animals to political office? Check. Creepy incest vibes? Uh, check please!</p><p>Now, I know what you fucknuggets are asking. Hey, Eric, <em>which</em> Roman Emperor are you talking about? How about this, dick-for-balls: <em>all of them</em>! As far as I’m concerned they can all take a swandive into the nearest volcano. The only thing that matters is that they sucked balls and now they’re dead. I only bring them up because Donny Lil’ Hands is the kind of turd on our national bedsheet who wants to drag the whole country backwards into the shitshitting <em>past</em>. That’s Lil’ Hands’ whole <em>deal</em>. He even put it on his hats. Make America Great Again? <em>Again</em>? Yeah, let’s just dredge up the refuse-heap of history! Instead of going forward, let’s go <em>back</em>! Let’s entomb ourselves among the bones of the dead! Great idea, Donny, you very stable genius! (Sarcasm.)</p><p>So yeah. Newsflash, you great jolly gentlemen of fuck: any coherent attempt at historical analogy is itself complicit in the politics it attempts to describe, if the very structure and content of that politics is determined by a fickshutting retrogressive movement into the past!</p><p>The only way to avoid collapsing into the puketrench of terror and barbarism that constitutes all previous ages is to maintain an intense meditative focus on the infinitely thin knifedge of the pissgargling present. I must obessively consume the news as it’s dripfed into my eyes. I must remembering nothing that happened yesterday and conceive of nothing that might happen tomorrow. Every day Donny Lil’ Hands pulls some fresh fuckery out of his soiled diaper, and every day I must eat it. My entire consciousness must be poured into this man, because if I notice for one second that time has passed, my children have grown up and stopped speaking to me, and I am now fast approaching the end of a life spent entirely in rage and fear, then I will slip into anguished consciousness of the past and instantly become transformed into Donny Lil’ Hands, who embodies not just any mere historical event but the monstrous totality of all that ever was.</p><p>All you guys are Nazis. Mic drop. Fuckity-bye. I’m out.</p><p><em>(Eric Schlob leaps onto the rim of the basket. Grinning wildly, great flecks of spittle churning in the wind, he leaps. There is a long silence. Finally, once Wen’s flicked his cigarette end into the sky, the stranger stands up and speaks.)</em></p><h4>A mysterious, hooded stranger: The case for 20,000</h4><p>Why are we in a balloon?</p><p>Does this not seem odd to anyone else? Someone put us here. Who? We must have agreed to take part in this roundtable. Why? What exactly is this group, CHAP(TAH)? Who funds it? Who governs it? Why are they so insistent that, in a world that seems to do nothing but mirror itself, nothing else that exists could possibly resemble the political career of Adolf Hitler?</p><p>At first, I thought I would find the answer in the forbidden act itself. What does it mean to use Hitler as a historical analogy? Why is the practice so endemic everywhere, to the extent that both sides of the American political divide routinely compare each other to Hitler, and both sides in the current war in Gaza compare each other to Hitler too, and both sides of the current war in Ukraine also compare each other to Hitler? How is it that all of them, if you look at it in the right way, have a point? I meditated on this for three thousand years. And eventually I considered that comparing something to Hitler is not actually a historical analogy at all. It looks like an <em>is</em> statement, a judgement about the nature of the world, but actually it’s an <em>ought</em> statement. When you say something is like Hitler, you’re saying it <em>must be destroyed</em>. If a person is like Hitler, it’s acceptable to use violence against them. If a political movement is like Hitler, you need to drop all your qualms and vote for the likeliest opponent. If a country is like Hitler, there’s no option except war. </p><p>So where does this leave CHAP(TAH), the sponsors of today’s debate? They want people to stop comparing each other to Hitler. Does that mean they want people to stop demanding unlimited war against all their enemies? If so, their way of promoting this idea is very strange. They have not just declared that nothing can be compared to fascism; they have sentenced anyone who violates that law to a violent death. In fact, they seem to be a very good candidate for exactly the historical analogy they want to forbid. Maybe this is why practically everyone in this balloon ended up talking, despite the punishment, about Hitler.</p><p>I meditated on this for another three thousand years. But finally, I found my answer. The reason I am here in this balloon has nothing to do with Donald Trump, and nothing to do with Adolf Hitler either. Everything I am living through is itself a historical analogy for <em>something else</em>.</p><p>Historical analogy is the practice of trying to make sense of the present by comparing it to the past. But I think the process runs the other way as well. Since its founding, the United States has loved to compare itself to ancient Rome, but it wasn’t really possible to really <em>understand</em> Rome—a society built on mass entertainment, shallow fads, exotic gods, and war—until it was echoed in the commodity-culture of the twentieth century. The English Civil War didn’t make sense until the French Revolution. The meaning of Alexander had to wait until Caesar: being <em>a conqueror</em> is meaningless when you’re the only one of the type. Alcibiades had to wait until Warhol. You will not find out what Donald Trump’s first months in power mean by rooting around in the past. They’re a presentiment of the future.</p><p>The year is not 2025. The year is 20,000. The Janae, who inhabit the hypermoon QS3-Janus, have been subjugated by the clown-kings of Xul Ai. This is not their first time being subjugated. Their hypermoon, which was once capable of simultaneously orbiting multiple planets on opposite sides of the galaxy, could give incredible power to whoever posessed it. But no one knows how it worked. The Janae descend from the people who once operated its machinery, and sometimes they’ll sacrifice a young girl to those ancestors, but mostly they grow steakfruit and wait to be subjugated again. One empire after another has grabbed QS3-Janus like a bauble, just in case it suddenly starts working again. <em>This</em> subjugation, though, feels different. Xul Ai sends filthy, emaciated soldiers, cannibals, but the clown-kings hop around their grim regiments in glittery scraps of pink and green. Despite being a generally sallow and bitter people, the Xul Ainese desperately want to be happy. This is why each troupe invests all political power in whoever entertains them the most. The other empires would put a viceroy on the hypermoon and leave; this one is staying to amuse itself. Its sense of humour is crude. A passing troupe will sometimes slowly peel an entire village for the sake of one weak chuckle. For the Janae, it feels like a horrible echo of the Winnowing, when a humanity made listless by its own power turned war into the final entertainment. The Winnowing only lasted for a month, but it’s still causing distant stars to blink out of existence, one or two every night, six thousand years later. Has it come back? Some of the elders of the Janae remember a story. There were clown-kings before Xul Ai. Back in the most ancient days of Old Earth, they had a clown-king called Trump. But the people of that doomed planet could only understand him by reference to the past, which is why no one got the joke until it was already too late.</p><p><em>(Lugubrious Wen stands up and punches the mysterious hooded stranger in the face. He tips the unconscious body over the side and watches it fall through the clouds. You talked too much about Hitler, says Lugubrious Wen.)</em></p>

Into the night. </em></p><div><hr></div><p>According to Abu Hurayra, the Prophet Mohammed once declared that ‘whoever sees me in a dream has truly seen me, for the Satan cannot assume my form.’ This hadith is collected in the Sahih al-Bukhari—the most authentic source of sunnah, and possibly the second most important book in the entire Islamic tradition. But in a way, the whole book emerged out of that one hadith. The story goes that around 846 AD, Imam al-Bukhari had a dream in which he was standing in front of the Prophet with a fan in his hand, driving away the endless clouds of flies that were trying to settle on Mohammed’s body. The dream interpreters told him this indicated his destiny, which was to dispel the myths and falsehoods that were trying to cloud the true religion. Because the Prophet appeared in the dream, its message was true. But if you take the hadith seriously, this means that what al-Bukhari saw wasn’t an image or a metaphor, but <em>Mohammed himself</em>, two hundred years after his death, who <em>really was</em> standing patiently in some zone of dream-space, actually allowing thousands of flies to buzz around him, waiting for the dreamer to arrive and swat them off. The people you see in dreams might be actual people. Or they might be the actual Satan. </p><p>Now, we know better. We dream alone, and everything in a dream is made of the self. Of all the folk-oneirocritical ideas floating around out there, maybe the most widespread is this: that <em>everyone you encounter in a dream actually represents some aspect of yourself</em>. So in al-Bukhari’s dream, the Prophet was actually just whatever aspect of himself he held in particular esteem. The flies were his secret doubts; the fan was his attempt to rein in his baser impulses. You get the picture. Dreaming is an adventure across the terrain of yourself, and any insights you receive through dreaming are secrets of the innermost self. It’s all about <em>you</em>.</p><p>But based on the dreams you’ve been sending in, I might have to push back on that idea just a little. Maybe it’s <em>because</em> the self is so all-pervasive in dreams that its edges start to blur. Sometimes it’s difficult to distinguish yourself from other people. Sometimes parts of yourself fall away: your name, your face, your teeth. Sometimes you take on a very different shape.</p><p>Last time, I asked if any of you had ever dreamed about <em>looking in a mirror</em>. Absolutely everyone who responded said it was a very upsetting experience. Some of you saw reflections that looked a bit like yourselves, but weird and mutated, faces distorted, bulging eyes or too many teeth, like a glitchy AI image. One reader’s reflection shattered like porcelain. Lucy saw herself as ‘a withered crone, mashing my grey, toothless gums.’ Yuri reports that his reflection had ‘black pits for eyes seeping with a clear sap-like material.’ Tori writes: ‘I look in the mirror and see that I have really pale blue eyes and dark hair (in waking life I have brown hair and eyes), I look down and see that my hands are smaller with stumpier fingers. Suddenly I break down and start crying that I miss my old body.’ An anonymous reader’s reflection was screaming in terror, and as soon as they saw their reflection they were assaulted with the sound of ‘violently crashing pots and pans.’</p><p>Anecdotal accounts from elsewhere on the internet seem to bear this out. While a few people insist that their reflections are perfectly fine, places like the r/LucidDreaming subreddit are full of stories of the horrible demons that appear in dream-mirrors. Usually, this is explained through the pop-psychological idea that mirrors symbolise your innermost fears about who you are. Or maybe it’s a bad idea to look in a mirror in a dream for the same reason that it’s a bad idea to look in a mirror on psychedelics. I have another theory. We’ll get there in the end.</p><p>But in the other world, even stranger things can happen to the self. Sometimes, it can disappear altogether.</p><h4>1. Dreams without a dreamer</h4><p>Ciaran writes:</p><blockquote><p>I’ve never actually been present in any of my dreams. I always thought it was odd when people talked about themselves ‘doing things’ in dreams, but I always assumed that they were retroactively putting themselves in the dream after they woke up. But no, it turns out that you guys are all walking around and having conversations in your dreams, just like in waking life. My response when I fully understood this was one of baffled horror, like when I heard that there are people who don’t have an interior monologue or who can’t picture objects in their minds—it seems crazy to me that people can’t dream without having an avatar of themselves. My dreams usually take the form of one very intense image. One that stuck in my mind a few weeks ago had an irrigation ditch full of very thick muddy water, where a group of people were performing ballet while wearing VR headsets. Their movements were very beautiful but their white costumes were absolutely soaked with mud. </p></blockquote><p>Ciaran is unusual in <em>only</em> having purely imagistic dreams, but I think the phenomenon might be more common than he supposes. One reader writes:</p><blockquote><p>I don’t know if this counts but often I don’t experience myself at all in dreams, it’s more like watching a little movie or sometimes even a cartoon. Here’s one from my dream journal:</p><p>A kind of cute anthropomorphic cartoon can of condensed milk is given a lump of what looks like smoking magnesium—he’s delighted by the gift—smiles at it—hugs it lovingly to his tin-can chest—at which point the reactive metal burns through his body and the condensed milk comes gushing out—expression of pure uncomprehending horror &amp; heartbreak—how could this thing I loved so much hurt me like this?</p></blockquote><p>Ian has another:</p><blockquote><p>I recently had a dream where the person known as Ian was in no way present. The dream was a lost episode of <em>Key and Peele</em>, in which the writers forgot to include any humour. The two of them lived in a small apartment in Queens above the laundromat they owned and ran together. While walking back from an exclusive laundromat industry party, Jordan told Keegan that he felt like he was getting sidelined in favour of Keegan’s new life partner. Keegan responded by asking Jordan if he was tired of the same routine, day in day out. ‘I’ wasn’t there. I was a camera held about waist height that looked up at the duo in long continuous shots. </p></blockquote><p>Beth had this dream in the 1990s, during the hopeful high point of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process: </p><blockquote><p>The camera of the dream looks directly across a huge expanse of a green baize table. The table is crowded by men in suits. The camera is directly opposite Yasser Arafat who is centrally positioned and in an intense and chaotic negotiation. My camera eye view is floating above the heads of the people on the other side of the table. I’m not part of their world. There are other important people there and the camera isn’t completely focused on Arafat. But at some point a black disk appears in the middle of his forehead. Nobody has noticed yet but dark blood begins to seep from the bullet wound. No sound was heard from the firing of the gun.</p></blockquote><p>What’s really notable here is that both Ian snd Beth use the same metaphor, of the dream-perspective as a <em>camera</em>. A camera is something that sees but is not present, an imaginary observer. The obvious question is this: are these dreams a product <em>of</em> the film camera? Did the invention of the abstract observer change the way we dream?</p><p>For once I can give a clear answer here: no, it did not. In fact, this kind of dream is very, very well attested in pre-cinematic sources; maybe you could call it the <em>prophetic</em> mode of dreaming. If we go back to the Sahih al-Bukhari, we’ll find one there: Ibn Abbas relates that a Muslim dreamed of clouds with their undersides dripping with butter and honey, and people collecting the sweet greasy mixture in their hands as it fell. But the dreamer wasn’t among them; he wasn’t in his dream at all. In the Bible, the two most prominent dreamers in prophetic mode happen to be <em>kings</em>. When Joseph is imprisoned in Egypt, he interprets the dream of the cupbearer, who dreams of squeezing grapes into Pharaoh’s cup, and the baker, who dreams of birds pecking at the loaves he’s carrying to Pharaoh on his head. (Joseph predicts that the cupbearer would be pardoned, while the baker would be hanged. Birds would peck at his corpse.) But in Pharaoh’s own dream, he doesn’t appear. ‘Behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.’ In the Book of Daniel, there’s a really fascinating incident: Nebuchadnezzar has had a bad dream, and he wants a wise man to interpret its meaning. But he refuses to tell anyone what his dream actually was; if they’re really wise, they should be able to guess. Obviously this is impossible, so he has all the magicians of Babylon executed. All except Daniel, who receives the content of the king’s dream <em>inside his own dream</em>. ‘Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible. This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass. Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.’ The statue represents the empires of worldly history. The rock that destroys them is God.</p><p>For what it’s worth, I’ve had some of these non-participatory dreams myself. I don’t experience a succession of images, or a cartoon playing out in my head. There’s no visuospatial element at all. Maybe it’s because of my particular vocation, or my habit of drafting essays in my head when I don’t have anything else to do, but I sometimes dream in <em>text</em>. I am not reading the text; I am not writing the text. In fact, I’m not there at all. Instead of <em>myself</em>, there’s just a sequence of words. These words are usually an incredibly brilliant and witty essay or work of fiction. I don’t think I’m the only one to have these; as I mentioned <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/strange-news-from-another-star-no-d92">a few editions back</a>, Samuel Taylor Coleridge received his poem <em>Kubla Khan</em> in a dream. Like Coleridge, I’ve occasionally managed to hold onto these dream-texts just long enough after waking to write parts of them down. A selection:</p><blockquote><p>“Bird oil” “Dog oil” “Frying a steak in dog oil”</p><p>Please Abhor The Closing Of The Door</p><p>Fate has decreed that he must perform the Five-Man Step (which only has four steps)</p></blockquote><p>What’s going on with these prophetic dreams? The dream researcher David Foulkes might have an answer. From 1968 to 1973, he conducted a massive longitudinal study of children’s dreams at the University of Wyoming, and discovered that very young children—those under five years old—seem to dream almost exclusively in the prophetic mode. Later, in his book <em>Children’s Dreaming and the Development of Consciousness</em>, he described the findings: </p><blockquote><p>Social interaction, which is the prime currency of the dream world in adult reports, was almost wholly lacking in the children’s reports. Only very rarely was there a description of an active self character, that is, of a self who actively participates in dream events, which is another general characteristic of adults’ dream reports. Only a quarter of the preschoolers’ reports described any locomotion or generalised movement; their dreaming was more like a slide than a movie… An animal dream report might be something like the following: a bird singing; a calf in its barn; chickens eating corn… Children rarely reported feelings of any kind in their dreams.</p></blockquote><p>As children get older, their dreams change. First, between five and seven, the static images become dynamic and eventually turn into small narratives. Instead of dreaming about animals, the child starts dreaming about other people. Between the ages of seven and nine, the child starts attaching emotional content to their dreams. Finally, children start to take an active role, inserting themselves into the scenario to perform various dream-activities. More cognitively gifted children might reach this stage around their seventh birthday. </p><p>Foulkes was very surprised by this, and I can see why. We make seven-year-old children <em>sit exams</em>, but his data suggests that some of them are not yet conscious of their own selfhood. And other studies bear this out. Guardo and Bohan (1971) found that younger children are sometimes confused by questions like <em>Are you the same person as when you were a baby?</em> or <em>Would you still be yourself with another name?</em>—but around the same time that they start inserting themselves into their dreams, they also start to conceive of themselves as a continuous, stable, bounded entity. Maybe the dream-self is an expression of this new awareness. Or maybe the work of getting there takes place <em>in the dream</em>, which is where you slowly learn to encounter yourself.</p><p>But where does that leave those of us who <em>aren’t</em> always represented in our own dreams? Are we mentally deficient, stunted, dumber than a seven year old? That really does seem to be the clinical consensus. In a 2021 study I <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/strange-news-from-another-star-bonus">mentioned last year</a>, Roesler, Konakawa, and Tanaka associated dreaming without self-representation with ‘a lack of subjectivity and self relationship, which manifests in a consistent refusal to participate in school or occupational activities, withdrawal from social relationships etc.’ The study’s participants were psychotherapy clients; those that just dreamed successions of images also found it difficult to ‘refer to the relationship with the therapist, in some cases even to consider the therapist as another person.’ Well, that kind of indifference to other people and nondelineated sense of self is probably what you get when you’re the Pharaoh of Egypt or King of Babylon. </p><p>This seems a bit harsh. Maybe we can just be Freudians here. We’ve learned that dreaming is ontogenetically <em>older</em> than the cohesive self, and as Freud points out, ‘in the realm of the mind, what is primitive is so commonly preserved alongside the transformed version which has arisen from it.’ Here, Freud is talking about his friend Romain Rolland’s religious, ‘oceanic’ feeling, in which the self becomes limitless, or melts into a world that is not distinct from it. Freud’s read is that this oceanic feeling is a remnant of very early childhood, before the ego detaches itself from the id. ‘An infant at the breast does not as yet distinguish his ego from the external world as the source of the sensations flowing in upon him.’ A few decades later, that milky infinity provides the raw materials for God. But it’s also there in dreams—after all, in a dream, the sense of not being distinct from the world around you is literally <em>true</em>. Imagistic, prophetic dreams might just be a stronger remnant of the world of early childhood, and we might all have more of them than we think. </p><p>Part of what makes early childhood so strange and interesting is that <em>we don’t remember what it was like</em>. We are cut off from our own pasts by a general amnesia. No wonder Freud decided all the essential truths of the psyche must be located there. But this might be because of the late development of the cognitive self: it’s hard to recall events that did not, strictly speaking, happen to <em>you</em>. But we also have difficulty remembering our dreams. They evaporate as soon as we try to think about them in terms of the waking bounded ego. If you were having imagistic, prophetic dreams every night—are you absolutely sure you’d realise?</p><h4>2. I am the Moon</h4><p>One of my favourite dreams ever submitted to <em>SNAS</em> is from Abigail, who sent this in more than a year ago. When she was a child, Abigail dreamed that she was <em>the Moon</em>:</p><blockquote><p>I felt my soul ascend to a rocky object orbiting the Earth, where I soon realized that I had inhabited the body of the Moon in the sky. I tilted at an angle and I observed Earth. I was stuck there for thousands of years: the time was all sped up, I felt the heaviness of enormous amounts of time passing, and I moved in a circle around Earth, changing perspectives. <br><br>The thing about the dream that stayed with me was the kind of absence of emotion and identity I felt as the Moon moving around Earth. My identity was sort of void, but it was also, in a weird way, my perspective of Earth. It was all I could see. I felt a more physical existence than I’d felt as a human, no feeling, just movement. I was lonely in the happiest way I had ever known. I felt beyond enormous, and I felt very ‘sure,’ in a way I don’t think I’ve ever felt since. But despite all of this, space was so deeply cold, like a metal box or like the wind getting sucked out of you. I was all wrapped up in nothingness :( and when I woke up I was a very happy little girl.</p></blockquote><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Abigail says she was around seven years old when this happened, which would put her at just the cusp of Foulkes’ transition. A lot of the features of this dream are familiar. She dreams a basically consistent image, the Earth, without any narrative or emotional content. But at the same time, she <em>is</em> the Moon; her being the moon is the whole content of her dream. </p><p>Even when you’re present in your dreams, and you’re not dreaming you’re the Moon, the dream-self is never quite the same as your waking self. Most notably, the dream-self almost always suffers from severe amnesia and has dramatically diminished cognitive capacities, but there are subtler differences too. I recently dreamed I was expertly taking apart a rotisserie chicken, slicing cleanly through the joints, portioning the whole thing in about six deft strokes. I can’t do that in waking life. My dream-self has abilities I lack. Like most people, I’ve also been physically transformed in dreams. I’ve discovered to my shock that I’m much older, fatter, or balder than I thought; I’ve lost legs or arms; I’ve spat out mouthfuls of my own rotten teeth. There’s been some interesting scientific work done on this stuff. For instance, Occhionero and Cicogna (2011) found that the dream-self is most like the waking body in REM sleep; in NREM sleep, you’re more likely to find yourself losing your teeth or wearing unfamiliar tattoos. </p><p>I’m not sure I’ve ever knowingly dreamed of being anyone or anything <em>other than myself</em>. Still, I was curious to see if other people had experienced similar vicarious dreams. Quite a few of you had. Here’s one reader’s dream:</p><blockquote><p>I recently had a dream where I was someone&nbsp;other than myself, which I’ve never had before. In my dream, I was an Uruguayan who was moving back to Montevideo from America for cheaper cost of living (I have no idea how I correctly placed Montevideo in Uruguay, I don't know anything about Montevideo or Uruguay). I met up with some old friends and we talked about our lives and how Montevideo had changed since I left for America. I don't remember if we were speaking in English or Spanish. After I told my friend that I didn't know what to do with myself, he told me, ‘It's not always good to be a lost star in the sky.’</p></blockquote><p>There’s an interesting variation in this account from Lucas, who dreamed of a featureless concrete room:</p><blockquote><p>The ceiling was not visible, no source of light could be seen, but it was well lit. It felt like an industrial setting.&nbsp;In this room were babies, more babies than one could possibly count, all placed lying on their backs on the floor. In the tight spaces in between the infants were an even greater number of rats, squeezing against each other and the babies or crawling on top of them. Every so often one of the rats would take a bite out of a baby's cheek or body, and the baby would scream.</p><p>Then I became aware that this was the setup to a video game that I was playing, a horror game. The game was extremely controversial but regarded by some as a provocative work of art, so I played it despite not playing games very often.&nbsp;In the game I took control of a baby who was placed there with the rats, and I had to find my way out. It was played in first person from the perspective of the baby and to me, in the dream, it was indistinguishable from being the baby.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The video game element here is particularly interesting. Lucas goes on to describe feeling, as one of the babies, the scratchy fur of the rats around him as he crawls over other babies to escape. You don’t usually feel stuff like that in a game. Where, exactly, is the dreamer here? Foulkes suggests that the mature dream-self should, like the mature waking self, be continuous, stable, and bounded. But in dreams, selfhood is capable of blurring or even bifurcating: here, ‘you’ are simultaneously a baby in some terrible torture chamber, and someone completely removed, maybe the same as your waking self, maybe not, abstractly cogitating on what the first ‘you’ directly experiences. </p><p>Another, from Casey:</p><blockquote><p>I dreamed I was a minuscule man of maybe Polynesian descent. (I am not such a being.) I have this giant&nbsp;fly agaric cap on my back, about 2.5 metres&nbsp;in diameter, growing neatly out of my spine. Somehow, this mushroom holds a miniature world. My wife (?) comes running up the stairs to talk to me, but instead of falling into my arms she moves through me, into the mushroom world. I know I will never see her again. I go staggering through my life day after day, trying to ward my friends off as they approach me, but they are each pulled into the mushroom in turn. Any being I encounter is pulled in. I stagger through reality with grief in my mouth like thrush, I can't touch anyone, I can't put down the mushroom. This horrible trek&nbsp;goes on for years and years. The dream lasted for so long, and the whole time I was watching that self in third person, utterly alone. I woke up sobbing for that strange fungal other that was also myself.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Casey describes himself ‘watching that self in third person.’ This is not an experience that’s ordinarily possible in waking life: we can only see the world through our own eyes. But it does happen in dreams. Dreaming in the third person—experiencing the dream as a ‘camera’ that observes a figure identified as ‘yourself’—is less common than the first person, but it happens often enough: a 1994 survey found that 42% of people dream exclusively in the first person, and another 30% mostly in first person, but that still leaves 58% of us doing <em>some</em> of our dreaming in third. According to the internet, dreaming in third person means that you’re ‘being called to look at the bigger picture of your life’s spiritual journey.’ Maybe. Interestingly, though, the same third-person perspective sometimes crops up in <em>memories</em>. Cognitive scientists distinguish between ‘field’ (first-person) and ‘observer’ (third-person) memories; in the latter, you see yourself within the remembered event, while ‘you’ float around, typically above your own head, watching things from a perspective no one actually experienced. Observer memories are technically a branch of the autoscopic phenomena, along with out-of-body experiences and schizophrenic hallucinations, but perfectly sane people experience them all the time. </p><p>Scientists and philosophers tend to take the view that observer memories are unreliable. Freud, who was one of the first to acknowledge them, was also one of the first to dismiss them. From <em>Screen Memories</em>: ‘Whenever in a memory the subject himself appears in this way as an object among other objects this contrast between the acting and the recollecting ego may be taken as evidence that the original impression has been worked over.’ Freud proposes that these memories have been subjected to the same transformations by puns and loose associations that constitutes dream-work. Once again, there’s some connection with the obscurity of early childhood. Freud notes that childhood memories tend to be observer memories, and I think this is true. My earliest memory is of eating mushy boiled carrots on the step outside my childhood home. It’s an observer memory: I can see myself as if through a camera. As it happens, this memory is accurate: I know, because I found the photo. I’d confused a picture with my own experience. Some empirical studies suggest that false memories are more likely to be remembered from an observer perspective; others have found the observer perspective might sometimes shield the ego from unpleasant or traumatic events. In 2008, the British Psychological Society released a set of recommendations on how the legal system should understand human memory; they cautioned that ‘an image experienced from a field perspective should not be assumed to be a more accurate recollection than an image experienced from an observer perspective.’ We really don’t know. But there does seem to be some aspect of the mind that wants to escape the cohesive self, to float around outside it. Remember that the cohesive self is a fairly late creation. We have mental processes that are much older, and not subject to its laws.</p><p>I have a further question. If you’re one of the 58% of people who sometimes dream of themselves in the third person, does your dream-self always <em>look</em> like you? Can you see its face? Are you <em>sure</em> it’s your own? </p><p>There’s a school of dream theory, most prominently espoused by the philosopher and neuroscientist Antti Revonsuo, that identifies dreams as a virtual reality in which the dream self—which is essentially the same entity as the waking self—can productively encounter various simulated problems. A kind of sandbox mode for reality. But I’m increasingly inclined to take the opposite view. The dream is a field of pure psychic phenomena that are to some degree autonomous, and sometimes, when an appropriate first-person perspective isn’t available, some part of the psyche will pick out one or more elements of the dream and identify them with the self. ‘That’s me.’ As in Lucas’s baby dream, it’s not always easy to draw a clear distinction between watching someone do something, and <em>being</em> that person, doing that thing. (This happens often enough in waking life—in the famous rubber hand illusion, people will start to feel sensations from a prosthetic hand in their visual field.) This account of things would finally explain the mystery of the upsetting figures in dream-mirrors. Looking into a mirror forces the dreamer to actually confront their dream-self, and what they usually discover is that it was never their self at all.</p><p>Sometimes, dream self-identification picks the wrong object. Maybe the starkest example is this dream from Niranjan:</p><blockquote><p>One of the most memorable dreams I’ve ever had was one in which I dreamed I was my own wife. I don’t have a wife; at the time I was living with a girlfriend but I was a very different woman in the dream. I could see myself in the third person: very tall, strapping, wide-hipped, brunette. In the dream I lived in a huge crumbling colonial-style house in the middle of the desert, and I kept having to haul huge buckets of water from the well inside. I bring them inside and find my husband—that is, <em>myself</em>—mopping the floor. He’s (I’m) doing a terrible job. I tell him (me) to hold the mop up straight or all the water will leak out. He sighs. I remember finding him very pathetic. </p></blockquote><p>This kind of autoscopy isn’t unknown in the literature. Here’s another, collected by Cicogna and Bosinelli:</p><blockquote><p>I was in a sort of South American country, two hundred years ago, I was mounting a horse: with me there were two more persons riding a horse, and other people on foot. We were pursuing a man, who was myself, we were pursuing him because he had some money, and I was observing the whole scene.</p></blockquote><p>Where is the self here? It’s the hunter, the hunted, and an abstract third-person observer, all at the same time. The pronouns wobble uneasily over these events. One iteration of <em>me</em> has to become <em>him</em>. The language of waking life, with its strict distinction between subject and object, can’t quite account for what goes on in the dream.</p><p>Since Niranjan doesn’t have a wife, we’d usually conclude that he was dreaming as someone who doesn’t exist. But the practice of vicarious dreaming has some very weird philosophical implications. The mature vision of the self is of a continuous, stable, bounded entity: you are the same person as when you were a baby, you would be the same person with a different name. But why? It can’t just be because you have the same body, unless you want to accept some fairly uncomfortable conclusions: that a perfect copy of you is the exact same person as you, but if you had a leg amputated you’d become someone else. Those who believe in the soul as a real but immaterial substance have an easier time of it, but otherwise the standard account is some version of Locke’s continuity-of-consciousness model. Here, a person is ‘a thinking intelligent being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing, in different times and places.’ You are capable of remembering your childhood: even if the content of the memories is false, that self-projection backwards in time establishes a continuity of self. </p><p>But as the philosopher Melanie Rosen points out, vicarious dreaming introduces a serious break in that continuity. Rosen imagines herself dreaming that she’s Napoleon Bonaparte. As Napoleon, she has no access to any memories of her waking life as Melanie Rosen, a philosopher who works at a university in the twenty-first century. As far as she’s concerned, she <em>is</em> the Corsican general and has never been anyone else. The dream-Napoleon has abilities that the waking Rosen lacks; he can ride a horse, lead armies into battle, and overthrow the feudal legal codes of Europe. This dream-self is also, unlike her waking self, male. Maybe it would be inappropriate to keep referring to her as ‘she.’ When Napoleon says ‘I see the battle of Austerlitz,’ Rosen insists that this ‘I’ doesn’t refer to the actual Napoleon Bonaparte, who is dead and can’t see anything, or to the actual Melanie Rosen, who is not actually present, but to the dream-Napoleon himself, who in that moment constitutes an entirely <em>distinct individual</em>. </p><p>Rosen concludes that vicarious dreaming produces ‘temporary conscious entities.’ Niranjan’s wife is a <em>real</em>, separate person who simply happened to share a brain with her husband. The Uruguayan’s friends might have been imaginary, but he himself was not. These individuals have their own distinct streams of psychological continuity, and they’re capable of reflexive statements: they’re every bit as <em>real</em> as the ‘you’ that you imagine yourself to be, even if they ‘exist only briefly, for a few minutes of REM sleep.’ To designate a dream-element as a self is to imbue that element with sapience. In other words, Imam al-Bukhari was right, and we were wrong. The dream is not all about you; it contains others. The people you see in your dreams really are actual people. There are conscious entities there, Satans and prophets, beings of no fixed shape, waiting in the depths of sleep. </p>

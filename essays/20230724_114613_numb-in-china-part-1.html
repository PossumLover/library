In these pages I’ve written a little about women, and a lot about freaks, but almost nothing about China. What is China? Where did it come from? What is it for? Were the weird old historians right when they said that the broadly integrative nature of Chinese institutions—the continuity of its civilisation, the pre-eminence of the state, and even the writing, which fixes the sign in its self-contained graphical mark, while Western systems break it up into constituent sounds—is grounded in Neolithic shamanism? Where are the good noodles? Is socialism with Chinese characteristics just another name for capitalism, or is it something else?</em></p><p><em>From now until September, Numb at the Lodge will investigate these pressing questions and more. Paid subscribers can join us in a brain-melting tourist odyssey across the past and future of Chinas real and imagined. This is a travel blog now.</em></p><div><hr></div><p>Today I am writing from Chaoyang, Beijing. Or, at least, I think I am, but it's getting hard to tell. It might be someone else.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>China is a strange place to be a foreign tourist. The government has spent a large amount of money making sure that practically everything in Beijing is plastered in Latin letters. All the street signs, the subway stations, the public notices, the restaurant menus: the whole city has grown a light fuzz of English. But as far as I can tell, this is just a prestige utility for local residents, like the baskets of flowers that hang from lampposts in posh neighbourhoods. Here in Chaoyang, rich educated young Beijingers talk to each other in a constantly seesawing combination of Chinese and English. Having English around makes them feel cosmopolitan, maybe. It certainly isn't for my benefit. A few decades ago, China was desperate for the barbarian tribes outside its borders to send some of their red-faced hairy-legged imbeciles here, to gawp and hoot at the achievements of Chinese civilisation and maybe spend some of their fat Western paychecks. But now China is rich and we are poor and they simply don't think about us at all.</p><p>Aside from the English everywhere, the whole of China seems to have been set up for the sole purpose of making life impossible for foreign visitors. For instance, you can't simply buy a ticket for the Beijing subway. Instead, you do it through your phone, which is much more convenient. This involves getting a WeChat account, which requires an invitation from a Chinese resident, and then linking it to your Chinese phone number, loading it with a Chinese type-I bank card, and authenticating it through your Chinese identity papers. But if you don't have any of those things, you are allowed to walk. Similarly, you can't book a ticket for the Forbidden City without a Chinese phone number, or get in a taxi, or even really buy anything. Most places don't take cash any more; they'll just have a QR code dangling from a bit of string. China might have invented paper money, but now it seems to have changed its mind. Increasingly, you can buy stuff with just your <em>face</em>: biometric scanners give you a quick once-over and you walk away with your stuff, with the cost automatically debited from your account. Very soon, if your face isn’t in the system, you won’t be able to do anything at all. </p><p>Of course, none of this is really <em>about</em> me. These deeply inconvenient conveniences are the last tangible effects of covid: doing everything via ID cards and biometrics means it's possible to keep track of exactly where everyone is and what they're doing at all times. Back when we still cared about the virus, this was widely held to be necessary, and it’s still pretty handy now. Foreigners are just collateral damage; nobody bothered to think about how all this would affect us, because who really cares? Beijing is still full of tourists; they’re just internal tourists. China, like America, is already a world. But it makes things very difficult for me. I do not have any principled objections to the regime of mass surveillance. In fact, I’m desperate for the machine to see and recognise me. But it will not. It thinks I'm someone else.</p><p>About a month ago, I spent a lovely long afternoon sweating in the China Visa Application Service Centre on Old Jewry in London. Roughly five hundred nerdy white guys were crammed in there with their Chinese girlfriends, waiting their turn. Every thirty seconds, the security guard would bellow in a warm Nigerian accent: 'Are we happy? Is everyone happy? Smile! Be happy!' I did my best to smile and be happy. After a mere eight hours or so, my number was called. I presented the official behind the glass screen with an immense stack of all the information I had to provide to enter the country. An alphabetical list of every train station I'd ever visited; a signed doctor’s letter confirming there were no abnormalities in my stool, a complete set of plaster casts of my milk teeth. She smiled and thanked me and said I could pick up my visa in a week, and I thought that would be that.</p><p>But instead, I returned a week later to find that the Chinese state had elected to issue a visa in my name to a total stranger instead. I know this is the kind of thing I'd normally make up as some kind of obscure satirical metaphor. But it’s completely true.

He has my name and my date of birth and even the same passport number as I do, but this is not my face. I said as much to the very polite and friendly official behind the desk. He looked at the picture again, and then scrutinised me carefully. ‘Are you <em>sure</em> that’s not you?’ he said. Yes, I said, I was sure. He looked between me and the picture again. ‘Have you ever shaved your head?’ he said. I guess we all look alike.</p><p>This kind of thing is not supposed to happen. People outside China persistently imagine it as a zone of perfect rational social control, and they are not always wrong. Qin Shi Huangdi claimed that he had given all objects their true names: the magic link between words and things ran through him, for everything and everyone under his domain. China’s greatest historical achievement, at least for early modern Europe, was its bureaucracy, and most of all the universal examination: everyone under heaven, without concession to rank or nobility, can and must be known, examined, numbered. The China Brain thought experiment imagines that the government of China has decided to organise its entire population into a single brain, with individual humans as neurons, simulating their electric sparks with walkie-talkies. Could China think? There’s the persistent belief that China’s social credit system—in real life, a slightly janky apparatus for measuring corporate trustworthiness—actually gives every citizen a numerical score representing their degree of loyalty and obedience, rewarding prosocial behaviour while punishing littering and dissent, with low-scoring individuals denied basic services and eventually shipped off to re-education camps.</p><p>In fact, we are not so individual, and China was never so collective. In the Book of Samuel, it’s recorded that King David ordered a census. ‘Go now through the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.’ This is, the Bible makes clear, a terrible sin. But not because it’s wrong to reduce people to statistics, or because bureaucratic power is a threat to the individual. God punishes David for his crime, but it’s the population that suffers: he sends a terrible plague that kills seventy thousand of the people David’s just numbered. If you try to know too much about the world, God will snatch it out of your hands; omniscience is his alone. The same thought was perfected in China. The Dao is hidden and has no name; the Dao that can be described is not the eternal Dao. </p><p>Half of Chinese history records people’s successive attempts to avoid being known. ‘When the Way appears in the world, appear; when it does not, hide.’<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> There’s a story in the <em>Analects</em>: the Duke of Sheh boasts that his people are so upright that if their father steals a sheep, they will report him. Confucius replies: ‘Among my people, those who are upright are not like that. A father will conceal his son’s wrongdoing, and a son will conceal his father’s wrongdoing. Their uprightness lies in this.’ Maybe what’s really frightening about being known isn’t the invasion of privacy: it’s being forced to confront yourself as you really are, in the indifferent eyes of the universal state, with all your many crimes and your many, many faults. Too much transparency is unbearable. Periodically, aspiring petty bureaucrats who failed the exams would revolt against the state. Most famously, Hong Huoxiu, a farmer’s son from Guangdong, failed four times and proceeded to declare himself the Son of God, form an army of fellow also-rans, and spark a war that killed some thirty million people. But the lines are never so clear. In the territory controlled by his Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Hong needed a bureaucracy, and to staff it, he needed to know who was competent enough. In 1851, he started holding universal exams.</p><p>One of Herman Melville’s best jokes is about the futility of refusing total knowledge. He mentions, in passing, the existence of a Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with Other People’s Business—which is mostly famous for its voluminous, all-encompassing bylaws.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde307f44-fea8-44db-a78d-4b1949e211d4_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde307f44-fea8-44db-a78d-4b1949e211d4_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde307f44-fea8-44db-a78d-4b1949e211d4_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde307f44-fea8-44db-a78d-4b1949e211d4_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde307f44-fea8-44db-a78d-4b1949e211d4_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde307f44-fea8-44db-a78d-4b1949e211d4_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/de307f44-fea8-44db-a78d-4b1949e211d4_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:486519,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde307f44-fea8-44db-a78d-4b1949e211d4_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde307f44-fea8-44db-a78d-4b1949e211d4_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde307f44-fea8-44db-a78d-4b1949e211d4_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde307f44-fea8-44db-a78d-4b1949e211d4_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>What’s distinctly modern isn’t surveillance or secrecy, it’s the <em>desire to be surveilled</em>, to be visible, to see yourself reflected in the system. Westerners, far more than Chinese, want to live under an all-seeing eye. A few years ago, there was some outrage when it turned out that Amazon’s facial-recognition software was consistently misgendering non-binary people: they wanted a machine that didn’t just observe them at all times, but could see into the heart of their subjective lives. They wanted a total state that could confirm, to themselves and everyone else, who they really were.</p><p>And I get it. I wander around Beijing, taking photos, and meanwhile it takes photos of me. There are thousands of facial-recognition cameras dotted around the city, on posts, on walls, on the eaves of the temples. But now I’m worrying that it doesn’t see me at all. I’ve been getting automated text messages welcoming me to attractions I have not visited and businesses I have not been patronising. Reminders for meetings I have not organised. Tickets for events I do not plan to attend.</p><p>The other one, the person with my name and my passport number but someone else’s face: he is here in this city, somewhere, moving at right angles to me. He seems to be an important person. He seems to be getting a lot done, for purposes I can’t even begin to imagine. In the last day, the other one has been talking to people at the Jingsheng Mechanical Corporation and booking a private flight to Shenzhen. The machine can see everything he does, while I’m stuck in the shadows: I can’t get on a train, I can’t buy food from a shop. I have joined the ranks of the invisible, the millions of migrant workers who’ve sluiced into China’s cities from the countryside, unidentified and unidentifiable, whose faces are unknown. Maybe I’m not really here; I imagine that I’m wandering around in humid Chaoyang but really I’m in the western wilderness, the River of Sands, among dead dunes on the furthest edge of civilisation where all the monsters and faceless men are condemned to roam. Maybe I don't even exist.</p><p>The other day, I was walking past a group of girls when one of them called my name. Suddenly they all wanted to take a selfie with me. The screen flashed, and for a split-second I saw it: not my face, grinning dumbly, but the other one’s, his. </p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>I'm still not sure where this leaves Confucianism in my matrix of religions: in Sunni Islam you can run but you can't hide; in Shi’ism you can hide but you can't run; in Catholicism you can both run and hide, and in Protestantism you can neither run nor hide. You will agree that this makes perfect intuitive sense.</p></div></div>

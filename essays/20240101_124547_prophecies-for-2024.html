Unfortunately, the year 2023 failed to hold its side of the bargain and accurately reflect all of them. For instance, I began by prophesying that ‘Donald Trump will not be the presumptive Republican presidential candidate by the end of 2023. Instead, he will be dead.’ I really didn’t give myself a lot of leeway with that one. I continued: ‘This is not a metaphor. I do not mean that his primary campaign will splutter out. I am not saying that his poll averages will decline. I mean that <em>he will die</em>: that his big wet sock of a heart will flop about one last time, and then stop.’ I’m writing this on the 29th of December, so there’s still some room for a miracle, but it looks like I was quite badly wrong here. And some mockers and naysayers might seize on this, and claim that I’m ‘not a real prophet’ and ‘not actually gifted with the holy curse of foreknowledge,’ that I’m ‘just a common-or-garden culture critic trying to imbue his basically standard-issue lefty opinions with a vatic woo-woo vibe for no very good reason,’ and that my so-called prophecies actually consist of ‘hunches, stabs in the dark, vague trend analyses, and sometimes just ordinary preferences, stated with a degree of overconfidence they don’t really merit’ combined with ‘actual nonsense mostly derived from Tarot cards.’ </p><p>As always, the mockers and naysayers are wrong. Consider my other prophecies. I revealed, for instance, that after Andrew Tate, the next big totemic cybercretin would be a girl who just screams at her audience to kill themselves. She has arrived in many guises, but one cultural figure who came to prominence online in 2023 is Hannah Pearl Davis, a young woman whose sole message to her mostly female audience is that women are stupid and useless and there is absolutely nothing they can do to rid themselves of the stamp of this condition. </p><p>I revealed that people would stop critiquing elite institutions and distance themselves from popular enthusiasms, and they have. I said that as part of this, people would stop talking about Ivan Illich and Jacques Ellul, and they <em>really</em> have. Illich used to be inescapable; I don’t think I’ve seen his name dropped once since the summer. The retreat from critique has been ongoing on the left for a while, but in 2023 it totally subsumed the right: whatever populist, labourist energies were still floating around there basically dried up as soon as 1) a man who calls himself Bronze Age Pervert pointed out that free-market dogmas are easier to reconcile with creepy bio-determinism and 2) an Austrian School devotee who gets his economic policies from <em>actual dogs</em> was elected as the President of Argentina. (I also said that people would stop talking about René Girard and they haven’t quite yet; I suppose it didn’t help that I wrote <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/11/overwhelming-and-collective-murder-rene-girard/">a big blockbuster essay on the man</a> in <em>Harper’s</em>.) </p><p>I prophesied that people would stop paying attention to the war in Ukraine, and I was possibly more accurate than anyone has ever been in human history. But even the new war in Gaza that’s replaced it in the spotlight has some of the same weird features I describe. War without war, destruction without antagonism. Israel directs aid trucks to feed its captives in Gaza; a few hours later, it decides those same people are enemies and massacres them. Hamas fighters film themselves infiltrating IDF camps and then <em>doing nothing</em>. Each side claims they’re trying to obliterate the other, but mostly they jointly produce an overwhelming sacrifice of the civilian population. </p><p>Finally, I prophesied that art would no longer attempt to bear witness to the present. In 2023, Zadie Smith—<em>Zadie Smith</em>, poet of the Kilburn High Road, the great witness to Willesden, chronicler of Cricklewood, the person who documented the life of the same shabby corner of north-west London where I grew up in glugs of polyphonous prose—published a <em>historical novel</em> set in the Victorian era. Meanwhile, the most talked-about book actually set in the present last year was something called <em>Yellowface</em>, which is about a white woman who becomes a literary superstar after stealing a manuscript from a better, more virtuous, more talented, but also dead Asian woman. This thing is notionally a satire of the publishing industry, but it also appears to have become a bestseller solely because the publishing industry decided to make it one. Does this really feel like an attempt to actually grapple with the questions of the present? Or is it, in fact, a retreat from the matter of actual life into a set of highly formalised—almost <em>medieval</em>—conventions?</p><p>Anyway, today I have returned from the mountain with seven further prophecies. I drew three cards for 2024: the Hermit, the Page of Pentacles, and the King of Pentacles. All auspicious cards! But the Hermit is a lonely card, and both the Page and the King are also solitary figures. The Hermit sets out with a lamp in the darkness. His journey is not a fruitful one: the Page stands in a blossoming meadow, but his only focus is on the glowing coin in his hands. The light that guides the way has become the only destination. Finally, the King sits in all his finery, but vines grow over his form. He looks like he’s been sitting there for a thousand years. Behind him, his castle lies in ruins. </p><p>This will be the shape of your year.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h4>Nobody will win the US election</h4><p>There’s usually a very reliable way to predict the outcome of American elections, which is that <em>the dumbest, funniest outcome is always what comes to pass</em>. But this year, there’s a problem: every possible outcome is dumb. It’s virtually guaranteed now that the election will be between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, which is <em>already</em> incredibly funny. It’s funny that in the most powerful country in the world, the democratic system—guarantor of human freedom, engine of prosperity, the treasure for which so many have died, and which must be imposed on the rest of the world by guile or force—has chosen the <em>exact same people</em> it did last time. Clearly, these must be the absolute best that America has to offer. And who are they? An incumbent who is so far gone that—let’s be honest—he does not reliably know that when the doctors try to gauge his awareness by asking ‘who is the President of the United States?’ the correct answer is actually ‘me.’ And the previous incumbent, who is <em>literally a clown</em>, a big fat clown from the circus with a lurid orange face, white circles around his eyes, and some implausible origami going on in his hair, a <em>hamburger-eating fucking clown</em>. </p><p>Biden is a funny candidate. Last go round, when a voter challenged him with some barely coherent objections, Biden called him a ‘damn liar,’ addressed him as ‘Jack’ and later as ‘Fat,’ and challenged him to a push-up contest. When one of those unbearable campus conservatives asked him how many genders there are, he replied that ‘there are at least three.’ He has a very enjoyable habit of just <em>wandering off</em>, physically or mentally, in the middle of whatever he’s supposed to be doing. But clearly, he’s not as funny as Trump. I don’t mean that Trump is a better comedian, although he probably is. But the act of re-electing Trump—whatever else it might be—would be <em>hilarious</em>. After all the high dudgeon of the 45th Presidency, the incomprehension when he won, the sense that culture had reached its final, lowest possible nadir, then the negative personality cult, the paranoid conspiracy theories on every side, the political obsessives all losing contact with any kind of reality, plunging into unreason, one after another, sacrificing their sanities in the name of Trump—and then afterwards, when it was all over, the crowds cheering and crying in the street, blubbing that they could finally be proud of their country again, now that order and civility had been restored, now that sanity reigned, now you no longer had to care about the people in camps at the border, now that the demon of pure spectacle and showmanship had finally been exorcised, and we could all go back to brunch, back to bipartisan infrastructure bills—after all that, to just make Donald Trump the President, all over <em>again</em>, is possibly the funniest thing that can be imagined. </p><p>Except—what about the possibility of a President <em>Kamala Harris</em>? Because it really is possible; it gets more possible with every neuron that fizzles out inside Joe Biden’s brain. And she is funny in a way that even Trump might struggle to match. There’s a Trumpian derangement of language: those sentences that coil and flex according to their own inner associative madness, so beautifully distinct from any of the stale forms of political discourse. But I’m not sure even Trump could come up with a statement as magnificently meaningless as ‘it is time to do what we have been doing and that time is every day,’ or ‘there is great significance to the passage of time in terms of what we need to do to lay these wires, what we need to do to create these jobs, and there is such great significance to the passage of time, when we think about a day in the life of our children and what that means to the future of our nation, depending on whether or not they have the resources they need,’ or ‘I think it’s very important for us at every moment in time and certainly this one to see the moment in time in which we exist and are present and to be able to contextualize it—to understand where we exist in the history and in the moment as it relates not only to the past, but the future,’ or ‘we should always find times to express how we feel about the moment that is a reflection of joy, because, you know, it comes in the morning—we have to find ways to also express the way we feel about the moment in terms of just having language and a connection to how people are experiencing life.’ </p><p>There’s something about <em>time</em>; whenever Kamala thinks too long about time, its passage, its movement, her pupils go wide and her brain starts generating chewed-up passages from <em>Sein und Zeit</em>. But actually, this drivel reminds me of something else. Last month, <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/a-dreadful-dim-fire">I noticed</a> that Disney’s latest offering contained songs with lyrics that weren’t just bad, but actively <em>meaningless</em>. It didn’t read like AI text, because AI text is actually very diligently coherent. It wasn’t just incorrect English; it read like it had been written by an entity with a very limited understanding of how <em>language</em> in general is supposed to work. It was written in Kamalese. And once you start noticing the Kamalese, you’ll notice that it’s <em>everywhere</em>. In advertising. In <em>books</em>. Trump’s madness is all his own; Kamala’s madness is the madness of an entire world. And that’s pretty funny.</p><p>So: a deadlock. Two equally dumb and funny outcomes. Neither can win. So neither will. The 2024 election will simply <em>never end</em>. The rallies and debates and frenzied arguments will continue past November, through all of 2025, and out the other end. Trump and Biden are the perma-candidates in the Forever Election; they’ll probably still be the perma-candidates long after their physical bodies have died. And already, events are conspiring to render the entire process infinitely indeterminate and interminable. Two states have announced that Trump will not appear on their ballots, and you morons take a stance on this based on whether you’re pro or anti <em>Trump</em>. It’s not about Trump. It’s about the ballot as a partial object, an incomplete text, an unfulfilled prophecy. It’s possible that one man and not the other will stand on some steps and recite an oath at some point, but that will not end the election. (Don’t be surprised if <em>both</em> men perform the ceremony.) Whoever ends up taking their shits in the White House, there will be no period in which anyone can be said to <em>have won</em>, and to be engaged in the government of the country. Election Day is just another pit stop before the next campaign event. Nobody pretends that elections are about <em>choosing a leader</em> any more; it’s been a long time since politics jad anything to do with making anything <em>happen</em>. America is not governed by its elected officials. The only thing that governs America is <em>the election itself</em>, the frenzy, the private neuroses of three hundred million Americans writhing in hostility against everything and all. </p><h4>Atheism will come back</h4><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Back in 2016, I <a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/degrasse-tyson-kriss-atheists">wrote an essay on the New Atheists</a> for the <em>Baffler</em>, in which I argued that they were all suffering from a very particular madness: they kept repeating things that were true but utterly banal, things that everyone already agreed with, as if they were dangerous and radical insights. The piece was very popular and very warmly received. Maybe that should have been my clue that something was up. In fact, my whole argument was bullshit, because I’d mistaken a brief zenith, the highest point on a seesaw, for an eternal empire. Since 2016, organised atheism has not fared so well. </p><p>It’s been routinely dismissed by snotty critics on the left, like myself: after all, if you don’t believe in God, you’re saying that you <em>know better</em> than billions of black and brown people in the global proletariat who do. But even a few years ago, I wouldn’t have predicted just how many of my old comrades would end up in the bony clutches of the Catholic Church. The biggest blow, though, came just this year, and on the right: Ayaan Hirsi Ali, tireless apostle of the Noneness of God, announced that she was converting to Christianity. Atheism, she’d concluded, isn’t enough to unite the West against China and Islam and ‘the viral spread of woke ideology.’ We need something to believe in, something more than <em>God is dead, do what you want</em>. And she, personally, needed something more as well. ‘I ultimately found life without any spiritual solace unendurable—indeed very nearly self-destructive. Atheism failed to answer a simple question: what is the meaning and purpose of life?’</p><p>Anyway, all this looks a lot like the beginning of an eternal empire. Which is why I think the seesaw might be about to pivot the other way.</p><p>The New Atheism died because it became smug, preachy, flabby, flatulent, and boring. There were a few years in which it felt genuinely daring to entertain non-pedantic notions of truth, or to consider that maybe the people who’d lived in the hundreds of generations before us weren’t just a bunch of obedient sleepwalking morons. Maybe we are not only monkeys. Maybe we are not sustained on atoms alone. But just like every daring proposition, this one has worked itself into a nice little groove, and now it’s just as flabby and flatulent as the last one. There’s a new type of insufferable nerd out there now, just as bad as the fedora-sporting atheists used to be. You know him. He has marzipan-chubby cheeks and a high nasal voice. He spells Tradition with a capital T. For some reason, he believes that his capital-T Tradition can mostly be found in the works of <em>JRR Tolkien</em>, whose nostalgic secondary-world-mongering would have been entirely impossible outside the context of industrial modernity. Even more bafflingly, he wants to identify his capital-T Tradition with <em>Christianity</em>, a messianic sect that proclaims the overthrow of history and the birth of a New World and a New Life. Last month, Substack’s own in-house magazine directed me towards one of those people, who had written a critique of TV weathermen. Apparently, weathermen are bad because they smile when the weather’s going to be sunny and make little sympathetic faces when it’s about to rain. He writes: ‘Therefore I say that the weatherman is the king of the ‘psyop’. He devilishly guides human hearts away from Christian penance, away from the multi-layered seasons of life and of love. His vocation is that of the anti-Western psychological warfare operator, extolling the tropical virtue of sun worship and languid, steamy climatic constancy.’ To which the only reasonable response is <em>oh God, you absolute bore, please, please shut the fuck up.</em></p><p>I am not an atheist. But I can tell when there’s a gap in the market a mile wide. This year, we’ll see the first stirrings of something new. It will, of course, involve a rejection of God and an incredulity towards religious ideas, along with a contempt for mass-market mysticism: manifesting, angel numbers, that sort of thing. But while the last atheist project took religious ideas on face value, as <em>propositional</em> claims about the existence of a supreme being, this one won’t be able to. Because so many of the most prominent believers now are like Ayaan Hirsi Ali: they don’t believe in God, not really, but they do believe in their own need for belief. </p><p>There’s a new dogma, which holds that the experience of modernity has left us utterly <em>lost</em>, without any meaningful narratives to make sense of our lives, without any meaningful communities to support us, cut off from the deep riches of the past, abstracted from the earth and its cycles, from procreation and childrearing, even alienated from our own <em>gender</em>, stuck in a technological daydream, alone… I might have made a few observations in this vein myself. But the next atheism will have little time for this sort of whingeing. Sorry, it will reply, but all that anomie is just another word for <em>freedom</em>. We have been <em>liberated</em> from necessity. We have <em>overcome</em> our biology. Modernity is <em>amazing</em>. And <em>of course</em> freedom has its dangers; there are always some people who’ll end up addicted to dumb pleasures, or wandering in circles, or paralysed in fear of the open sky. But it’s still better to be a wild animal than an animal in a cage, and this pining after lost certainties is just the cry of an animal who can’t make it in the wild, desperate to be put back in its cage. No dice, bitch! The glory and the tragedy of our existential condition is that we are condemned to be free!</p><p>And then, in about seven or eight years, this argument will be another smug flatulent dogma. Another seven or eight years after that, and religion will come back. For reasons that must remain mysterious to us, this is how God has chosen to regulate our affairs. </p><h4>The Tories will win the UK election</h4><p>While America boils in its own juices, we in Britain have a different kind of choice. The Conservative Party, which has managed the country for over thirteen years now, is coming apart at the seams. They no longer know what they want, who they’re supposed to be pandering to, or how. Under their watch, the country’s institutions have entered a state of general collapse. Hospitals will not reliably treat the sick. Schools will not reliably teach the young. Average wages are 3% lower than they were in 2008. You could never really afford to live anywhere, but now you also can’t afford to eat. Meanwhile, it’s apparently beyond our capabilities as a nation to build a new railway line, consisting of pieces of metal on top of pieces of concrete, between London and Manchester. There was a Tory Prime Minister who had some kind of a plan to prevent this decline, but that plan made things so much worse that her government collapsed in fifty days. The party is wiser now. It has given up trying to do anything at all. Its current approach is to bicker interminably with itself as it waits to be voted out, at which point this will all be someone else’s problem.</p><p>The Labour Party, meanwhile, is united behind a clear, well-defined mission: to continue doing whatever the Tories have been doing. </p><p>There is absolutely nobody who thinks the Tories will win the next one, but they will. American elections are determined by <em>what would be funniest</em>, but Britain is very different. Here, you have to remember that everything that happens is <em>God’s punishment</em> on the inhabitants of this cursed isle. The question you have to ask is this: <em>how will God choose to punish me today? </em></p><p>The Tories don’t even want to win; they’re desperate for a nice long rest in opposition. God will punish them with glory. Some piece of culture-war idiocy will swoop in to rescue them; it always does. Maybe the Rwanda thing will pay off. The Labour Party, meanwhile, seem to believe that victory is so certain they don’t even need to work for it. They won’t commit to any new spending; they factor every Tory tax cut into their forecasts. They don’t plan to do anything <em>differently</em>. If this country has gone badly wrong, it’s because there were <em>bad Tories</em> in government; exchanging them for the nice Labour front bench will be enough to sort it all out. Just shelve big doughy Keir Starmer in Number 10, and wages will rise all by themselves. God will punish the Labour Party with another five years of Tory policies to imitate. And us, the British people, we who wallow in the fens of this grey and blasted land; we fat and loud and cretinous; the mawkish, the tasteless, the crass—God will punish us the way he has been punishing us for our entire miserable history: by giving us exactly what we want. </p><h4>The West will embrace Nowruz</h4><p>This is more of a plea than a prophecy, but there has got to be <em>something</em> for the bleak months we’re now entering. Late autumn is an objectively disgusting time—the squalls, the leaves dying on the branches and rotting on the ground, the days that get shorter and shorter and shorter until it’s dark at half past three in the afternoon and life feels like a damp preview of death—but it’s made bearable by Christmas. As soon as October splatters on your face, everything is suddenly covered in tinsel and holly. The lengthening, commercialised Christmas is a wonderful thing. But once you’re on the <em>other side</em>, there’s nothing to look forward to except the distant, pathetic hope of summer. Result: misery, sluggishness, suicide.</p><p>Lunar New Year is good, but it falls too close to the solar one. Easter is nice, but the Lenten calendar leading up to it doesn’t exactly inspire hope in the blue days of late January. But Nowruz is the answer: the entire grim period from New Year to March should be one long excited buildup to Nowruz. Supermarket shelves suddenly full of pomegranates, figs, pistachios, sumac. Big warm fires. Tambourinists on the streets. A time to grow and oil your beard. Nowruz already has a whole host of warming, convivial, and seasonally appropriate traditions built in. Fire-jumping on Chaharshanbe Suri. Growing wheatgrass for your Haft-Seen table. Visiting your family; cleaning and prettying your home. Finally, everyone gathers together for the huge traditional feast. Sabzi polo. A big roasted fish. Aubergines with kashk. Nan-i Nokhodchi. Khoresh Fesenjan, which is to my mind one of the most delicious things on the planet. I’ll be celebrating Nowruz this year. You should too.</p><h4>You will forget how to speak</h4><p>When generative AI tools were just entering widespread use, people briefly started acting as if this technology would make writers and artists obsolete. Some were deeply worried, but plenty were crowing. Who needs writers, with their egos and their agendas, when anyone can just have GPT generate an entire novel for them in an instant? Who needs artists, with their obsessive interest in their own genitals, their refusal to reduce art to some tawdry principle of <em>beauty</em>, when DALL-E can make infinite iterations of kittens in baskets and pinups in outer space? This was, of course, stupid. AI will not replace human artists, because there’s nothing it can do that human artists can’t. In most industries, raising the organic compositional of capital—that is, automation—makes short-term sense. Art is not one of them. In particular, automation adds literally no value to the production of prose, since <em>human writers will already work for free</em>. The reason some writers <em>don’t</em> write for free is that they have a vague fetishistic aura surrounding their name. That aura, and not the actual material they produce, is worth money. (This is even more true when it comes to art.) And a vague fetishistic aura is not something you can automate. </p><p>In other words: I will be absolutely fine. But you might not be.</p><p>People have already started to notice that schoolkids are automating their homework. We’re carrying on as if the current model of education is still practicable, but it isn’t. There are no tools that can reliably distinguish AI from human prose, and <em>all the kids are doing it</em>, every single one. Why wouldn’t they? Assessors want schoolkids to produce a <em>perfectly average, formulaic essay</em>, and AI excels at producing averages. There is, as it happens, a way of teaching that’d be impervious to AI: it would involve the rote memorisation of written texts, combined with the <em>quodlibet</em>, free-flowing debates in which new concepts can bloom. For the very rich, education might start to take this sort of shape. For everyone else, there will inevitably be some cack-handed attempt to <em>integrate AI into the classroom</em>. The result will be that we’ll simply stop trying to teach students how to learn, retain, and deploy information. After all, it’s not like they’ll need to do any of that in adult life. The machines can do it instead.</p><p>In February 2023, a university got in hot water for issuing a ChatGPT-generated letter to students after a school shooting. The letter said things like ‘we must recognise that creating a safe and inclusive environment is an ongoing process that requires ongoing effort and commitment’ and ‘one of the key ways to promote a culture of care on our campus is through building strong relationships with one another.’ Really, their mistake was <em>admitting</em> that this had been written by AI. Since most written communication is expected to be perfectly average and formulaic, why wouldn’t you? Again, <em>everyone is doing it</em>. Nobody mentions it, but every memo, every letter, every email, every birthday message to your mum, every proposal of marriage is now being written by the machines. Literary<em> </em>prose isn’t being automated, but <em>ordinary communication </em>is. And from 2024, you will start to forget how to speak for yourself.</p><p>You don’t hang out with your friends any more, but you have a group chat. Increasingly, your messages to your group chat will be written by AI. The machines will communicate for everyone in the same friendly, even tone, and everyone’s group chat will contain the same roster of mildly funny memes. You will look at them and feel nothing, and push a button to generate your response. <em>Ha! That’s so funny, Dave! You’re the Meme King!</em> </p><p>You don’t meet people any more, you use online dating. Increasingly, your conversations with prospective lovers will be written by AI. Your machine will generate banalities at her machine, about tacos and <em>The Office</em> and pineapple on pizza, and her machine will do the same, until it’s time for her to autogenerate a nude. You will look at it and feel nothing, and push a button to generate a response. <em>Wow you’re so sexy</em>. And then, having never spoken to each other before, you will never speak to each other again. </p><p>Sometimes, you might try to express something in language by yourself. The result will be a concatenation of unconnected and unsignifying words. Kamalese.</p><h4>The Dutch are up to something</h4><p>I don’t know what it is, and I don’t know when, but at some point in 2024 we will have to endure some kind of fuckery on the part of the Dutch. My personal nightmare scenario goes something like this. Thanks to Geert Wilders’ efforts, the impossible takes place and the Netherlands exit the European Union. At which point the obvious next step is to build a <em>new</em> European superstate with the other rejectamenta of the continent, the other spastic kids in the lunch room—that is, with <em>us</em>. And so, just as in the distant past, the streets of London will start swarming with the unbearable Dutch.</p><p>I acknowledge that the Dutch have produced some extraordinary art and some acceptable architecture, but they are also sick. There is something badly wrong with their society. These people are a mutated clone of ourselves; the entire Dutch culture is a failed attempt by continental Europe to create—although God knows why they’d want to—a second version of the English. The language, obviously. The first thing I saw on visiting their country last year was a food magazine that said <em>AARDAPPELEN IN DE HOOFDROL</em>. No, absolutely not. There’s a minor cultural phenomenon in which Americans discover that, for instance, the Dutch for <em>spank me daddy</em> is <em>geef me een klap papa</em>. Impossible to take yourself seriously while speaking that nonsense, but these days the Dutch don’t, not really. Young Dutch people talk to each other in English. They read books in English. Their whole world is in English. It’s an Anglophone country that sometimes pretends otherwise. I just wish the rest of their culture would die out with the language, because none of it is worth keeping. Certainly not the food; there is nothing so miserable as Dutch food. Their national dish is called stamppot, and consists of mashed potato and a sausage. Which would be fine, if it came with a bit of gravy, a nice sauce to hold it all together, but it doesn’t. Other dishes include kroket, which is deep-fried greyish goo, and bitterbollen, which is deep-fried greyish goo in a different shape. Everything they do is governed by miserliness and malice. Did you know that if a Dutch person invites you to their home for dinner, at the end of the night they will <em>present you with a bill</em>? Did you know that if a Dutch family have one of their children’s friends over after school, the kid will be expected to sit quietly somewhere while the family have their meal together? Everywhere else in the world, there is some lingering notion of hospitality, <em>xenia </em>or <em>diyafa</em>; among the Dutch, <em>wij gaan zo eten</em> is another way of saying <em>get out of my house</em>. Are you surprised that they keep voting for anti-migrant parties? Are you surprised that they invented so many of the instruments of modern capitalism? What we call capitalism is just their national sickness, raised to the level of a system, so we all have to deal with it.</p><p>In 2024, do not trust the Dutch.</p><h4>The media will shrink until it can fit in your brain</h4><p>In 2024, more and more online magazines you’ve never heard of will go bust. Goodbye, <em>The Spatula</em>. Goodbye, <em>PopChasm</em>. So long, <em>infogu.nk</em>. Substack too, eventually. All these places were only sustainable because of social media: every few months, one article would drum up enough attention and generate enough clicks to secure the dribble of VC funding that paid everyone’s salaries. Did you read <em>the piece</em>? people would ask. Today’s scathing review. Today’s bold new rant. But meanwhile, the average article on <em>Gawker</em> or wherever was read by literally <em>no one</em>. I know, because a few articles on <em>Gawker</em> linked to my previous blog, and absolutely nobody clicked. Perfectly decent articles; they just didn’t get the lucky spin on Twitter that day, and that was it for them. Nobody—<em>nobody</em>—is reading the front page of <em>Frenzy Mag</em> or <em>The New Caterwaul</em> every morning. But now that social media is dead, that’s what you’d have to do to stay abreast of the discourse: to know what was being <em>said</em>.</p><p>In 2024, the media will shrink until it’s manageable again. Once, if you wanted to know what was going on in the literary world, you just needed a subscription to a few blockbuster publications: <em>Harper’s</em>, the <em>New Yorker</em>, the <em>LRB</em>. Everything would be in there. And your job was just to read it: you were part of the <em>reading public</em>; everything was for your benefit but nothing required you to take part. In 2024, we will start to return to that state. </p><p>A lot of writers will lose their livelihoods in the process. A few will try to start newsletters, and probably fail; we’re reaching saturation point, people don’t want to have to wade through an entire dead industry’s worth of shit in their inboxes every day. A very small number—and not necessarily the most talented—will get rescued by the big mainstream publications. But most will have to do something else. And while I deeply regret the ruined dreams of everyone who briefly got to recap TV shows for a living, this isn’t a terrible price for having a coherent, digestible mainstream again. One that isn’t governed by algorithmic fluctuations or the twisting of clickshoals. One that moves slowly and thinks about things. The mainstream media is coming back. And you might not think so now, but you will be grateful.</p>

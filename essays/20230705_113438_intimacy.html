In practical terms, you need to start with some inciting incident. A child is murdered, a holy symbol is desecrated. A football match. Or even a rumour will do. In France, a child was murdered. Nahel Merzouk, seventeen years old, executed in broad daylight by the police. Not every death or blasphemy makes riots, but in France, things are bad. Food consumption has fallen by 17% over the past two years, the kind of figure that feels like it should belong to a nineteenth-century famine. Most of that drop is inevitably concentrated among the poor. The secular enshittification of European life runs deepest in the suburbs of Paris. People are hungry, and hungry people, when insulted, form a crowd. For a crowd, you also need a city: riots are an essentially urban phenomenon; maybe the only kind of human behaviour that’s almost entirely unique to civilised—that is, city-dwelling—life. So many strangers in so little space, coagulating around the news. But a crowd isn’t enough; even hungry people aren’t really as violent as their critics would have you believe. The word <em>riot</em> describes what happens after a crowd is attacked by the police. Some kind of mimesis at work. The riot can only act violently once it has already come into being as a riot, rather than simply a crowd, but it can only come into being as a riot if there is already violence. No individual member of the crowd can act first. The spark has to come from outside: everything that follows is in imitation of the violence of the state. It can be small. A single cop shoves a single member of the crowd. A single muscle, twitching once. And then, only an hour or two later, cities hundreds of miles away are in flames. </p><p>Even that is not always enough. Political demonstrations happen all year round, and sometimes there are windows smashed and cars torched and shoving matches with the cops—but true riots, like all sacred events, are tied to the seasons. Only in summer: a portion of the zodiac belongs to violence. The sun is a weapon. The sun is a drug. You need to be dazed and giddy; you need to feel your organs swelling in the daytime heat. And then, after sunset, you need the slick, mosquito-buzzing evenings, when the clothes cling heavy to your body and the bats come out at dusk. A dense black summer night, demanding fires to replace the sun. </p><p>The word <em>riot</em> is Old English: before it stood for a specific type of mass action it meant dissolute living, wantonry, extravagance. The French word for <em>riot</em> is <em>émeute</em>: literally, <em>emotion</em>. Our usual sense of the word—private, delicate, bourgeois feelings—is a late invention. Once, every emotion was a riot.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>What France has, and what the rest of the world lacks, is a culture industry responsive to emotional life. Somehow, America has not produced a single piece of significant culture responding to the 2020 protests and riots, or really any of its protests and riots: nothing since <em>Do The Right Thing</em>. A weird silence. Even rap music barely touches it. (There’s been a lot of stuff about <em>race</em>. This is not remotely the same.) But France has <em>La Haine</em>, and <em>Les Misérables</em>, and <em>Athena</em>. I liked <em>Athena</em>: probably the best thing Netflix has ever commissioned. Critics appreciated its visual gorgeousness, but they thought it felt <em>thin</em>, like a feature-length music video, which is exactly what it is. Its brothers aren’t vulnerable and loveable like the friends in <em>La Haine</em>; they’re all just compacted clots of rage. Strangely, the critics also kept comapring it to a Greek tragedy, and Romain Gavras kept propping up the idea. But the Greek theatre maintained a total taboo on onstage violence; the deed is always invisible. There’s only a single visible <em>blow</em> in the entire corpus of Greek tragedy, in Aeschylus’ <em>Prometheus Bound</em>. Instead, <em>Athena</em> is quite clearly a <em>Homeric epic</em>: the <em>cité</em> is a Troy under siege, Karim is a banlieue Achilles, Abdel is Ajax, Sebastien is something like a god. Karim’s fury is intense, aristocratic, even kingly; epic figures do not need tragic depth. As a piece of art, it’s beautiful. But Gavras is obsessed with the imagery and spectacle of riot, and gets the actual material all wrong. This riot is tightly organised, premeditated: <em>rational</em>. It bears almost no relation to what an actual riot is.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe47ff39e-7d7b-4c5d-b680-b3c456d9173b_2048x1152.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe47ff39e-7d7b-4c5d-b680-b3c456d9173b_2048x1152.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe47ff39e-7d7b-4c5d-b680-b3c456d9173b_2048x1152.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe47ff39e-7d7b-4c5d-b680-b3c456d9173b_2048x1152.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe47ff39e-7d7b-4c5d-b680-b3c456d9173b_2048x1152.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe47ff39e-7d7b-4c5d-b680-b3c456d9173b_2048x1152.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e47ff39e-7d7b-4c5d-b680-b3c456d9173b_2048x1152.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:631420,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe47ff39e-7d7b-4c5d-b680-b3c456d9173b_2048x1152.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe47ff39e-7d7b-4c5d-b680-b3c456d9173b_2048x1152.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe47ff39e-7d7b-4c5d-b680-b3c456d9173b_2048x1152.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe47ff39e-7d7b-4c5d-b680-b3c456d9173b_2048x1152.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>After the 2011 riots in England that followed the police killing of Mark Duggan, a team of academic researchers at the LSE’s Department of Social Policy interviewed nearly three hundred people who had participated, trying to gauge what it <em>feels like</em> to be in the moment of an <em>émeute</em>. The riots destroyed £200m worth of property; over a hundred families were made homeless; five people were killed. But they felt like freedom. ‘It felt like someone was holding onto your shoulders in like a hug for a long time, and then they just let go, like, no drugs could make you feel like this.’ Ecstatic unreality. ‘It was like a dream, it was like a game... I felt alive, there’s no word to explain it. It was like that first day it happened will always be the best day of my life.’ In so many accounts, you get the same phrase. Another respondent: ‘That was the best three days of my life.’ Another: ‘It was crazy. It was one of the best moments of my life but one of the worst at the same time.’ We are dealing with something outside the ordinary patterns of time. Something like a dream.</p><p>It’s unfashionable to notice this kind of thing. On the left, especially among those on the left who do not themselves riot, the usual gesture is to appropriate the riot as a form of productive political activity or a strategy of resistance. We want to believe that rioting is <em>good</em>. I was once lightly scolded by a comrade for using the word at all; the correct term is not <em>riot</em> but <em>uprising</em>. And so we feel deeply wounded and betrayed when rioters attack the wrong targets: when they don’t just burn police stations and government buildings but libraries and bookshops, or when they vandalise Holocaust memorials. In 2020, rioters in Atlanta attacked the CNN building, leading some liberals to theorise that the crowd had been infiltrated by Trump supporters and neo-Nazis—because why else would they attack CNN, which is <em>on our side</em>? You can never admit that the riot has its own, extrapolitical logic. Joshua Clover writes that the riot is essentially a collective action that aims to set the prices of consumer goods. The Situationists, responding to the Watts riots of 1965, conclude that the rioters are upholding the primacy of use-values against exchange-values. Which is now the standard left-liberal defence of looting: a broadly immiserated swathe of people have been taunted with these commodities, so now they simply take them; justice is done. (Often, looted objects are not luxury goods: bags of rice, toilet paper, everyday essentials.) It's also the standard grouchy critique: <em>these rioters are just consumerists in masks</em>. But it's simply not true; the riot has nothing to do with useful consumption. We want to believe that the rioters are engaged in the same kind of activity that we are, which is <em>critique</em>. We assume that people riot because they are <em>angry</em>. But that’s not it at all.</p><p>What’s the alternative? If a riot isn’t political resistance, doesn’t it collapse into something inchoate, instinctive, blind mindless violence? This is the standard right-wing position, that it’s all just criminality, usually tied up with some kind of perverse racial fantasy. So the recent riots in France are all down to the presence of foreign elements, Islamists, Africans, barbarians. (This is, worryingly, also the language used by the French police unions. <em>Hordes sauvages</em>; <em>nuisibles</em>.) Rioters are, almost by definition, people who have no real connection to French civilisation or its republican values. And so are their families and neighbours and anyone else who might find themselves on the wrong end of a policeman’s gun: if you were truly French, we wouldn’t have shot you. The victims of Europe’s crisis end up as perpetrators: all of this is because they’re not European enough. Which is so shameless it’s almost admirable. Republican values! Where did those come from? What, exactly, happened on that frenzied summer day, July 14th, 1789?</p><p>But the riot is not <em>less</em> than politics; it’s bigger, much bigger. It only superficially resembles the forms of political violence—protests, strikes, war. The actual emotional <em>experience</em> might be closer to a religious ecstasy, or sex, or death. Georges Bataille’s name for it is <em>intimacy</em>. ‘The world of intimacy is as antithetical to the real world as immoderation is to moderation, madness to reason, drunkenness to lucidity. There is moderation only in the object, reason only in the identity of the object with itself, lucidity only in the distinct knowledge of objects. The world of the subject is the night: that changeable, infinitely suspect night which, in the sleep of reason, produces monsters.’ Intimacy is erotic, even gregarious. One of the LSE study’s participants describes it: ‘One of the things that struck me was the way that a lot of people who obviously didn’t know each other were, I dunno, kinda clubbing together.’ Another remembers people ‘walking together, talking side by side, everyone was talking, like no one was a stranger, it was just the community, people, as one...’ Bataille: ‘Intimately, all men are one.’ Which sounds nice, until you remember the wreckage and the victims. The law of intimacy is not use-value but <em>sacrifice</em>. ‘Immense squanderings are about to take place.’ It belongs to general economy: economic systems when viewed as a whole, not in their restricted form as book-balancing. Life overflows itself. It radiates dangerous surpluses, and when a point of unbearable pressure is reached, the only solution is an immolation: vast destruction and waste. A fire that needs and admits no justification.</p><p>James Baldwin came close to understanding how this works, before suddenly shrinking back from the void. ‘Grabbing off the TV set? He doesn’t really want the TV set. He’s saying screw you. It’s just judgment, by the way, on the value of the TV set. He doesn’t want it. He wants to let you know he’s there.’ Except <em>he is not there</em>. He has vanished into the dream, the erotic ocean of intimate emotions. The great sacrifice isn't the looted commodity, it's the looter himself. Every rioter is a secret ascetic. These fires and thefts are the mortification of the flesh.</p><p>The rioter knows that what they are making is not a revolution. (Revolution is what happens when state agents unilaterally <em>refuse</em> to attack the crowd: essentially, a riot in reverse.) Every emotion is fleeting, and all intimacy is brief. The state will return, and it will have its revenge. There will be punishment. This is why moralists often point out that the rioters are not just wantonly destroying their own neighbourhoods and their own communities; they are literally <em>throwing away their own futures</em>—which is to say, their selves, extended forwards in time. But that’s the point. As Bataille points out, what distinguishes intimacy is a majestic indifference to the future. ‘If I am no longer concerned about ‘what will be’ but about ‘what is,’ what reason do I have to keep anything in reserve? I can at once, in disorder, make an instantaneous consumption of all that I possess.’ </p><p>Riots are fun: this is what nobody, except the rioters, is willing to admit. A dangerous fun, beyond enjoyment or the self. The secret pleasure of extinction. This is not entirely <em>good</em>. For what it’s worth—and without presuming to tell anyone else what to do—I would like to see not just an end to police murder, but also fewer bookshops and libraries burned, fewer families homeless, fewer Holocaust memorials vandalised, fewer people self-immolating on hot summer nights. I am, at heart, a soppy humanist lib. And for all his posturing about human sacrifice, Bataille is too. His prescription is, on its face, very plain—and he knows it. ‘It seems rather disappointing to have nothing more to propose, as a remedy for the catastrophe that threatens, than the raising of the living standard.’ By which he means boring old bog-standard mid-century social-democratic redistribution—which remains, I think, the only answer. Not to quieten the rioters, to buy them off with a few state-administered payments, keep them happy so they don’t do it again.

For those that aren’t aware of him, Nick Land is a British philosopher formerly associated with the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit at Warwick University, a militantly weird formation that kept insisting it did not and would never exist. CCRU was interested in the inorganic, the incoming of the outside, digital feminisms, and Deleuze and Guatrari horribly inseminated with Lovecraft; in particular, it liked attaching the prefix ‘hyper-’ to things. During his CCRU days in the 1990s and 2000s, Land took a lot of speed, took his students out to jungle raves, and wrote sentences like ‘Cybergothic slides K-space upon an axis of dehumanisation, from disintegrating psychology to techno-cosmogony, from ideality to matter/matrix at zero intensity, from a mental ‘non-space,’ ‘non-place,’ or ‘notional void’ that results intelligibly from human history to the convergent spatium from which futuralisation had always surreptitiously proceeded: print cryogenises, but hypermedia melts things together, disontologising the person through schizo tech-disassembly, disintegrated convergence.’ Some people profess to find this impenetrable; I happen to think it’s great. Then, eventually, Land quit amphetamines, quit the academy, moved to Shanghai, and started writing internet essays about Hitler and Trayvon Martin and how the welfare state is subsidising an eventual racial apocalypse. He also wrote a guidebook to the 2010 Shanghai World Expo. This is, you have to admit, an interesting trajectory. The conventional wisdom is that Land simply ‘went mad,’ which feels like a dangerously undertheorised way of putting things. Another view is that he was just following his philosophy to its logical conclusion, which was always fascism; all that 90s cyber stuff is not just embarrassing but evil, and should probably be burned. The most <em>interesting</em> interpretation holds that he did go mad, but only because there’s a thought-demon encoded into Marx’s notes for Volume III of <em>Capital</em>, a demon made entirely out of inferences that ended up killing Engels and driving a wedge between Bernstein and Kautsky, and which still disintegrates the mind of anyone who <em>truly</em> understands the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. But I wanted to find out for myself, so I had some mutual acquaintances reach out to the man. In response I received a large table of kabbalistic computations followed by a set of coordinates. The set of coordinates marked the exact location of my home in London. That felt like a pretty unambiguous threat. I left things there.</p><p>I decided that it didn’t matter whether or not I actually met Land, because I could simply <em>hypermeet</em> him instead. I would, after all, be in his city. Paris belongs to Walter Benjamin, California belongs to Jean Baudrillard; in my mind, Shanghai had already started assuming Landian dimensions. The black machine-hive in which capital assembles itself out of the materials of its enemy. Where China’s opening-up is at its most open: total laceration, the entire country unfolding itself into a hypercube to welcome the uncertain energetic field of the Outside. Where in the final phases of the pandemic, the people ossified into their homes by the dually intercontaminating anthropogenic viruses of SARS-CoV-2 and douyin digital infoflow exhausted all modes of electronic communication and stuck their heads out the windows to collectively scream fury and terror without words: screaming, in one of the most technologically advanced cities on the planet, screaming like savages, like animals, the unmodulated six-hundred-million-year scream of metazoan biolife ripped between the jaws of virionic artificial underlife and silicoadministrative artificial overlife in the mastication zone of the future we call xeno-China-X. </p><p>So I was very surprised to step off the train and discover that the place is nothing like that at all. Chongqing was a cyberpunk xenozone; Shanghai is essentially just a nice northern European city—I think it’s somewhere in the Netherlands, which would explain why everyone speaks such good English—that has mysteriously come under the administration of the CPC.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>It simply <em>does not feel like China here</em>. After nearly two months in the sweltering belly of China, after walking through cities where every face turned to stare at me in incomprehension as I passed, after eating at restaurants that really did have dog on the menu, after the non-Euclidian geochaos of this place, arriving in Shanghai was an intense culture shock. It’s too <em>normal</em> here. In Shanghai, everyone’s tshirt is fashionable and expensive; it is not hiked up around their belly, and if it features any English text that text is an elegantly designed brand name and not the words ‘THE FUTURE IS CHEESE’ or ‘SUMMER: THE BEARSS IS GOODS, WARMTH YOUR SUMMER.’ In Shanghai, you are never more than fifty metres from a nanobatch coffee shop called Black + Bean or a place that does really good tapas. The motorists are sensible, the streets are well-planted, and they’re absolutely <em>crawling</em> with white people. British-accented businessmen in blue suits and slicked-down hair. Jolly Germans o-ho-hoing at the rarer vintages in the deeper corners of the wine shops. Skinny Russian girls outside the pâtisseries, posing fuckably with this week’s meme pastry. The buildings rise from half-timbered peaked-roofed Euro-suburbia to the monumental Edwardian Gothic sandcastles of the Bund. All the big skyscrapers are across the river in the new district, which is where they belong. There is, it’s true, one area with a lot of Chinese temple-style buildings, all crammed with little Chinese restaurants and Chinese groceries—but every big European city has a Chinatown too.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c0b0c5-44a2-42a0-aa82-8f9ec5cf5b9c_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c0b0c5-44a2-42a0-aa82-8f9ec5cf5b9c_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c0b0c5-44a2-42a0-aa82-8f9ec5cf5b9c_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c0b0c5-44a2-42a0-aa82-8f9ec5cf5b9c_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c0b0c5-44a2-42a0-aa82-8f9ec5cf5b9c_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c0b0c5-44a2-42a0-aa82-8f9ec5cf5b9c_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e9c0b0c5-44a2-42a0-aa82-8f9ec5cf5b9c_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:694490,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c0b0c5-44a2-42a0-aa82-8f9ec5cf5b9c_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c0b0c5-44a2-42a0-aa82-8f9ec5cf5b9c_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c0b0c5-44a2-42a0-aa82-8f9ec5cf5b9c_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c0b0c5-44a2-42a0-aa82-8f9ec5cf5b9c_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This europification of Shanghai is not a new phenomenon. In the decades after the Treaty of Nanjing there were attempts to squeeze little europuscules all over China: Tianjin, Xiamen, Wuhan, Qingdao—but Shanghai was the jewel. Huge tracts of land where Chinese laws did not apply and Chinese people could only enter at the white man’s pleasure. They tried to build an idealised version of the sedate, rational Europe that would inherit the world, here in the feudal muck of the late Qing. All those very handsome houses. All those gently shaded streets. Even Europe’s four-year psychotic break from 1914 to 1918 didn’t halt the project. On the Western Front, French and Germans murdered each other with machine guns and poison gas; in China, in their neighbouring concessions, they built nice plastered houses full of light. But the whole project was based on the opium trade, and it came out woozy and noirish, with all the mad ironies of a smacked-out fever dream. ‘I sometimes wonder,’ wrote JG Ballard (born Shanghai, 1930), ‘if everyday reality was the one element missing from the city.’ In the twentieth century, Shanghai had become a planetary gutter; it caught the dregs of every continent. White Russian exiles, pogromists who’d wiped out entire families in Ukraine, holed up in Baghdadi Jewish hotels. Pure-eyed Protestant missionaries here to bring the good news of Jesus to uncomprehending masses of Chinese. Degenerates of every stripe. Armies. Most business was done in Mexican dollars: there were plenty of warlord states with their warlord currencies, capturing Shanghai and then losing it again, but the <em>real de a ocho</em> is always a reliable lump of silver, and silver bought a lot. One in twenty women in Shanghai were prostitutes. In the Great World amusement centre you could enjoy six stories of gambling dens, opium dens, jugglers, earwax extractors, dried fish merchants, and brothels, and then on the roof there was a special platform so those who’d ruined themselves could jump to their deaths. Shanghai had gun-runners, river pirates, warlords, communists, celebs. Charlie Chaplin. Noel Coward. Costume competition at the Cathay Hotel: dress like you’re fleeing a sinking ship. The winning couple came to the party wearing only a shower curtain. Extraordinary, mythic gangsters. Zhang Zongchang, who ate dog meat every day to nourish his notoriously huge cock. Du Yuesheng, who had monkey heads sewn into his clothes for good luck. Morris ‘Two-Gun’ Cohen, onetime bodyguard to Sun Yat-sen, then roving enforcer for the warlords. He was born Moszek Abram Miączyn in a Polish shtetl. But everyone in Shanghai came from somewhere else. The French zone was patrolled by colonial police from Vietnam; the British zone was patrolled by turbaned Sikhs. Even the Chinese were outsiders. They’d fled the continuous massacre and famine in the rest of China for Shanghai: to work in the factories or coolie in the international zones, to get addicted to opium and die. Somehow, this chaos of debauchery, in a country constantly at war with itself, was the world’s third largest financial centre after London and New York. Sometimes world-history happened in the gaps between decadence and crime. In 1927, at the height of Shanghai’s Jazz Age, Chiang Kai-shek—backed by the pimps, the gangsters, the French, the British, and all the city’s most notorious partiers—cracked down on the local communists and trade unions. As part of their pacification of the city, KMT soldiers mutilated and killed any woman with short hair or unbound feet. ‘The bobbed-haired girls are the worst,’ one told a British reporter. ‘They are very arrogant and talk back defiantly. We have had to kill hundreds of them.’</p><p>This mad dream was still taking place in East Asia. Eventually geography shook the Shanghailanders awake, even if it took a while. The first massive Japanese bombardment of Shanghai took place in 1932, after some Japanese Buddhist monks were attacked by a mob; white residents picnicked by the Suzhou Creek to watch the Chinese city burn. In 1937, after three months of brutal fighting, Japan finally ground down the city’s defences and inherited its rubble. For a while, the international concessions were an island of prosperity and heroin in the middle of an active war zone, where reality only leaked in by accident. Like the two bombs that hit the Great World, blasting right through its baroque maze of birdcages and temples to savage gods, and leaving a thousand people dead. But finally, in 1941, Japan declared war on the Western Allies and dissolved the international concessions. The rich Americans were transported to Japanese prison camps. The Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe, meanwhile, were moved into a ghetto. Japan’s allies in Berlin kept telling them to liquidate the Shanghai ghetto, insisting that all the city’s Jews were mysteriously anti-Nazi, and an anti-Nazi would inevitably be anti-Japanese. The story goes that the Japanese military governor asked the Rebbe Shimon Sholom Kalish why it was so important to the Germans that all the Jews should be killed. The rebbe responded: because we are short with dark hair and we come from the east. The ghetto was spared. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8f60ab1-24e8-42c5-890d-34e8684309ec_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8f60ab1-24e8-42c5-890d-34e8684309ec_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8f60ab1-24e8-42c5-890d-34e8684309ec_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8f60ab1-24e8-42c5-890d-34e8684309ec_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8f60ab1-24e8-42c5-890d-34e8684309ec_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8f60ab1-24e8-42c5-890d-34e8684309ec_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f8f60ab1-24e8-42c5-890d-34e8684309ec_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:452710,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8f60ab1-24e8-42c5-890d-34e8684309ec_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8f60ab1-24e8-42c5-890d-34e8684309ec_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8f60ab1-24e8-42c5-890d-34e8684309ec_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8f60ab1-24e8-42c5-890d-34e8684309ec_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I tried to visit the Jewish Refugees Museum, which is housed in the former Ohel Moshe synagogue, and contains mainland China’s only Holocaust memorial. I’d been warned not to mutter anything in Hebrew while I was in there. China maintains a list of five officially sanctioned religions—Daoism, Buddhism, Islam, Catholicism, and Protestantism. Judaism didn’t make the list, which means that any Jewish worship is a legally uncharted territory in the People’s Republic. But I didn’t have to worry: the museum was closed. The old Anglican cathedral, designed by George Gilbert Scott, was now the local headquarters of something called the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, which oversees official Protestantism in China. It was also closed. </p><p>A lot of things in Shanghai were closed. During the colonial era, the big European-style blocks were filled in with longtangs: dense tracts of alleys and brick hovels for migrant Chinese. Now all the longtangs were boarded up and eerily silent. The local government is renovating them. Until recently, some longtang residents still shared their kitchens with four other households and had to shit in a chamberpot. Now they’re being moved to modern high-rises on the outskirts of Pudong, and soon all the longtangs will be bright and clean with indoor plumbing, to be inhabited by someone else. But when the new residents turn up to claim their own piece of Old Shanghai, only to find that their arrival has killed the place for good, they’ll be pleased to discover that one piece has been preserved. </p><p>Just across the road from the Ohel Moshe synagogue is the Raffles City North Bund Mall, and in its basement there’s a food court that’s an eerily perfect recreation of the longtangs of a century ago. Fake grimy alleyways with fake grotty buildings. Creepily lifelike fibreglass garlic-hawkers with weatherbeaten faces. All the details are right: the rusty drainpipes, the chaotic bundles of telephone wire strung between the houses. Except that this longtang is dominated by big fast-food chains. And while the real Shanghai was the scene of constant political turmoil, this place has no radical newspapers, no Communist graffiti, and no mutilated bodies displayed on the street.</p><p>Baudrillard wrote that ‘Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real.’ I started to think the Raffles City North Bund does the same thing. Shanghai was always a mimetic city: it imitates, and when there’s nothing left outside to imitate it imitates itself. Like Roger Caillois’ schizophrenic, who feels himself becoming ‘similar, not similar to anything, but just similar.’ But imitation is not isomorphy; imitation is our name for how madness expresses itself in history. The Europeans tried to build an image of Europe on the Yangtze, and instead they ended up creating modern China by mistake. Thanks to them, Shanghai was one of the few places in China with a full-fledged urban proletariat; the Communist Party of China was founded at a secret conference in a former girls’ school in the French Concession in Shanghai. Later, when the Europeans had Chiang crush the workers and kill every girl with short hair, it ended up sparking a Chinese Civil War that ended, more than two decades later, with Mao Zedong governing the entire country. </p><p>But Shanghai is <em>still imitating Europe</em>—only this time, it isn’t Europeans doing the imitation. When Europeans imitate Europe in Shanghai, you end up with a Chinese Century. When Chinese imitate Europe in Shanghai, you get—what?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766fbe15-5245-468b-a3f0-b6677c97650b_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766fbe15-5245-468b-a3f0-b6677c97650b_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766fbe15-5245-468b-a3f0-b6677c97650b_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766fbe15-5245-468b-a3f0-b6677c97650b_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766fbe15-5245-468b-a3f0-b6677c97650b_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766fbe15-5245-468b-a3f0-b6677c97650b_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/766fbe15-5245-468b-a3f0-b6677c97650b_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:489133,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766fbe15-5245-468b-a3f0-b6677c97650b_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766fbe15-5245-468b-a3f0-b6677c97650b_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766fbe15-5245-468b-a3f0-b6677c97650b_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766fbe15-5245-468b-a3f0-b6677c97650b_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In 2001, Shanghai’s government launched an initiative called ‘One City, Nine Towns’ to ease the city’s housing crisis. It didn’t work. The nine towns in question were a series of suburbs to be built in a ring around Shanghai; unlike most suburbs in China, which tend to consist of enormous, identical high-rise blocks, these would consists of large houses on big plots of land with plenty of space: the kind of place Westerners get to live in. And to underscore the connection, each of the nine towns would be themed to resemble a different Western country. So Luodian in Baoshan District is a treacly replica of the old Swedish town of Sigtuna, complete with a pointy Protestant church tower and lots of gambrel roofs. Gaoqiao in Pudong directly copied an entire street of narrow canal houses from Amsterdam. Meanwhile, the job of planning Anting German Town in Jiading was given to the architect practice of Albert Speer. No, not <em>that</em> Albert Speer: just his son. Maybe aware that putting the Speer name on some big trad celebration of Germany would have unfortunate implications, Albert Jr instead chose to replicate the sort of new residential districts that surround places like Stuttgart or Düsseldorf: dense, vaguely Bauhaus-y blocks, six storeys high, with peaked roofs and lime-green façades, on pedestrianised streets along a canal. It was a total disaster. That kind of urban form <em>works</em> in Germany because German cities tend to be compact with bike lanes everywhere and plenty of easily accessible services, but Anting German Town is surrounded by freeways, factories, golf clubs, and farms. The only way out is via the G42, a ten-lane monstrosity that carries traffic two thousand kilometres from Shanghai to Chengdu. Anting is a ghost town now. Almost all its apartments are empty, streets deserted, shops closed. All the Nine Towns are like this; the project was an enormous failure. All except Thames Town.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185c8fff-2887-4637-a36a-7d2bb5185917_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185c8fff-2887-4637-a36a-7d2bb5185917_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185c8fff-2887-4637-a36a-7d2bb5185917_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185c8fff-2887-4637-a36a-7d2bb5185917_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185c8fff-2887-4637-a36a-7d2bb5185917_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185c8fff-2887-4637-a36a-7d2bb5185917_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/185c8fff-2887-4637-a36a-7d2bb5185917_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:503755,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185c8fff-2887-4637-a36a-7d2bb5185917_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185c8fff-2887-4637-a36a-7d2bb5185917_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185c8fff-2887-4637-a36a-7d2bb5185917_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185c8fff-2887-4637-a36a-7d2bb5185917_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Thames Town is, of course, the British one. And since God’s chosen punishment was to make me British, this was the one I visited. I knew what to expect. Thames Town is a fantasy Olde English idyll: <em>golden lawns, village green, Victoria was my queen</em>. There are half-timbered cottages and Regency terraces and Victorian lampposts and red phone boxes and even a very British-seeming sort of bollard. There are statues of great Britons, including Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Princess Diana, and Harry Potter. There’s also a big church, with no actual sacred function, which is based on one in Clifton Down in Bristol—but while the original is all solid limestone, the replica is white and grey with a fake slate spire and doesn’t look English at all, more like a Disneyfied version of France. But this doesn’t matter much. A lot of homes in Thames Town were never sold, but the shops are still open and there are always plenty of tourists: Chinese couples come here to take wedding photos. All the glamour and grandeur of a real English wedding, without having to leave the city. This is what I was prepared for: a Chinese knockoff of my home country.

At first I was only lightly weirded out. Imagine learning that there’s a tiny Pacific island where the local people, working with mud and coconut husks, have built a large lifelike statue of you. I remembered that there’s a guy in China who looks exactly like Barack Obama, and another who looks like Elon Musk. Maybe everything and everywhere has its replica here, its China twin, its Chinaself. Maybe among the one point four billion people who live in this country there’s a Chinese Sam Kriss walking around, with no idea that he and I are copies of each other… But eventually these paranoid thoughts faded. It was so easy to just accept that this really was England, and so hard to keep reminding myself that I was actually in China instead. There was something tugging me downwards, the soft Thames Town lull. You have been travelling for so long, it said, in such a strange and foreign land, and isn’t it nice to be back home? Haven’t you had your fill of da zha xie? Wouldn’t you fancy a cheeky Nando’s instead? England was calling me, in the voice of the old autumn gods, the ancient call of hedgerows and flyovers and lads puking all over each other on the train. I started to wander in something like a trance. It hardly even surprised me when I turned a corner to see it there, just down the end of the road, glowing blue and white in the darkening dusk like a picturebook heaven. Tesco’s! Wonderful! I could get some mini Melton Mowbray pork pies. I could get some Granny Smith apples, a cheese twist, the <em>Daily Mail</em>, and a two-litre bottle of Lilt. Strange, though: the more I walked towards that glowing Tesco Express, the further it seemed to recede from me. I was on a country lane now, thick-fringed in blackthorn and ash. I leaned against a bus stop for a moment, trying to remember where I was, and an Arriva bus spluttered to a halt on the road next to me. The doors opened. I stared at the driver. He stared at me. We looked exactly alike, except he was Chinese. Come on then mate, he said, are you getting on or wot? And I wanted to do it, get on the bus and let it take me home. But what about my stuff? I said. My Chinese bus driver-self gave me the same quizzical scowl I give other people when I think I’m better than them. My stuff, I said again. I had trouble fully thinking it through, but a hazy image was rising in my head: my suitcase, containing all my clothes, and a half dozen books, and my laptop, and all those souvenirs I’d bought, sitting in a hotel room in—of all places—<em>China</em>. If I just got the bus home now, it would be such a <em>faff</em> to get all my stuff back. I’d have to talk to the hotel. I’d have to fill in <em>forms</em>… Slowly, I started to shake my head. My busdriverself shrugged. Fuckin lanky spacker, arentchew, he said. The doors closed. The bus left. The Tesco’s faded. I got a cab back to Shanghai.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76d32f97-02b6-47c0-ab06-4bf6f9bbb854_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76d32f97-02b6-47c0-ab06-4bf6f9bbb854_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76d32f97-02b6-47c0-ab06-4bf6f9bbb854_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76d32f97-02b6-47c0-ab06-4bf6f9bbb854_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76d32f97-02b6-47c0-ab06-4bf6f9bbb854_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76d32f97-02b6-47c0-ab06-4bf6f9bbb854_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/76d32f97-02b6-47c0-ab06-4bf6f9bbb854_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:430942,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76d32f97-02b6-47c0-ab06-4bf6f9bbb854_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76d32f97-02b6-47c0-ab06-4bf6f9bbb854_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76d32f97-02b6-47c0-ab06-4bf6f9bbb854_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76d32f97-02b6-47c0-ab06-4bf6f9bbb854_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>There is an obvious interpretation. China is attempting to build a network of portals into Western countries for espionage or possibly even military purposes. One day the good folk of Basingstoke might wake up to find the People’s Liberation Army marching past their doorsteps, having tunnelled in to Britain through a secret chain of resemblances. Maybe there’s a reason so many Chinese cities are now building perfect copies of the bland suburbs of the USA. But I find this all very unlikely. I don’t think the Chinese have any idea that the portal exists; if they did, I find it hard to imagine they’d let civilians just wander through without even checking their ID cards first. But Nick Land knew: that must have been the point of those co-ordinates. To tell me that I was not actually going to Shanghai, because I’d never really left.</p><p>Here’s my theory, for what it’s worth. The developers behind Thames Town wanted to build a charming bucolic sophisticated England that existed only in their heads. But they cut costs and used lazy designs and cheap materials, and in doing so they ended up building the <em>actual</em> England by mistake. Because the ‘actual’ England, the one in Europe—it’s <em>also a crap imitation of itself</em>. Faux-Georgian houses. Faux-Victorian morals. Snivelling toffs, piss-downing lads, middle-class wankers who like brutalism and the Fall: all of us behaving exactly how we’re supposed to, as if there’s some distant model out there of which we’re only the copies. This postindustrial raft of a country, barely floating on a sea of Chinese imports and Chinese credit. Everything we have is made somewhere else, so we can all eke out a living performing humiliating little services for each other. I really do mean what I’m implying here. <em>Thames Town is the original, and England is the imitation.</em> Europe’s future under sinocapitalism won’t involve any Landian fantasies of synthetic shoggoths and insect war. Instead, China simply transforms itself into a hypereurope so flawless that any existing europes are revealed as having always been second-order imitations. Those cottages in the French Concession were hideously out of place when they were built by Europeans a hundred years ago; now that Shanghai simply <em>is</em> a European city—which is to say, a pastiche, abstracted out of history—they fit right into place. It was American imperialism that tried to turn Europe into a copy of America; Chinese hegemony has no interest in repeating the procedure. China likes European luxury goods: our olive oil, our wine, our haute couture, our universities, even our liberalism. All these things are compatible with a gentle, harmless Thames Town-world. There’s nothing to fear, because it’s all already complete. Maybe, if you look closely at the callus on your heel, you’ll find it: the little mark that says <em>Made in China</em>.</p>

Eight years ago, I moved to Brighton to spend a year reading Adorno: to learn why slippers and light music and cheap restaurants and expensive cocktails are all actually <em>fascism</em>, coterminous with the death camps and the Final Solution. I guess it felt like a good idea at the time. </p><p>For much of that year, I was also completely broke. I got a job at a pub and managed to work a single shift before the owner discovered that his wife was cheating on him with his closest friend. His response was to have a psychotic break, fire us all, and sell the place to a property developer to be turned into flats. Sometimes I’d write a piece for <em>Jacobin</em> or <em>The New Inquiry</em> and make a hundred pounds or so; sometimes people would recognise me on campus as I stomped around like Raskalnikov, mortifying in my shabby old coat spotted with little beads of fuzz. At the time I had a few thousand Twitter followers and a blog; the University of Sussex campus was probably the only place on the planet where my name meant anything to anyone. One person told me that she’d had a one-night stand, and afterwards the guy had asked her if she’d ever read any Sam Kriss. This story was meant to be embarrassing for him, and her, and also for me. <em>Look who likes you: the kind of loser I’d fuck</em>. It was. </p><p>I stole food from the big Sainsbury’s off Lewes Road. I stole books from the big Waterstones in town. I was paying just under £400 a month to live in a damp, poky semi-detached house in Moulsecoomb, a mostly impoverished suburb that had been built on Brighton’s outlying swamplands in the early 1920s. That swamp was still lurking there, unseen, beneath the tarmac. It gave us the black mould that speckled the corners of our ceilings and the green slime that coated our windows from the inside. It bubbled out of the grass when it rained. Once, this had been a home fit for heroes to live in, but our landlord had different ideas. He’d converted the living and dining rooms into bedrooms, to cram in extra students. We ate off a rickety flatpack table in what had previously been the downstairs hallway, and which was also where we hung out our washing. There weren’t enough chairs. My own room was only accessible through a door in the kitchen, in a thrilling breach of all known fire regulations. I couldn’t afford to go out much, so I ended up sleeping with my housemates instead, which was also thrillingly forbidden until it turned out to be just another mistake. I think I must have been very unhappy.</p><p>When I needed to get to uni, I usually walked. A line of hills separated my hovel from the campus in Falmer; the quickest way there was to trudge up over its sodden crest and down again. From the very top you could just see the sea, a tiny mocking patch of glitter between the dull grey earth and the dull grey sky. It took about forty minutes; sometimes I’d stop to look for magic mushrooms growing in the cowshit. (Over the course of that year I found exactly one, which I boiled up into a tea and drank to no effect whatsoever.) If it was truly pissing down, though, I’d have to take my chances with the train. Moulsecoomb is one stop away from Falmer on the East Coastway Line, but the service had been franchised out to Govia, one of the firms founded in the 1990s to wring a profit out of our formerly nationalised railways, and they were fucking it up very badly. Their 7:29 service from Brighton to London, for instance, had arrived late every single morning for that entire year. Trains were often crammed and unreliable, and they also cost more than I could really afford, so when I did take one I would simply not pay. There were no ticket gates at Moulsecoomb, and at Falmer they were usually left open: I could just jump on the train and off at the next station, and spend my short journey having small neurotic dreams about what I would do if someone in a uniform ever asked to see my papers.</p><p>Obviously, this ended up happening. They always catch you in the end. One day I arrived at Falmer with my bag full of Freud and Hegel to find the ticket gates resolutely shut and a man in a blue pullover inspecting everyone’s documents by hand. Too late to turn around now. When my turn came, I pretended to search through my wallet, but <em>oh no</em>, my ticket wasn’t there, and how could this have happened? I suggested that if the man in the blue pullover let me through the gates, I could buy another ticket from the machines on the other side. I was practically pleading with him; I must have seemed very pathetic. He pretended not to understand me. If you’re travelling without a ticket, he explained, you have to pay a fine. That was all. No <em>look I’m sorry mate but</em>, no <em>I’m afraid I’ll have to</em>, not even an<em> only doing my job</em>. There was a horrible little smile buried in the corners of his mouth. Grim exultation, like a hunter who’d just brought down a fat prize. My fine came to over £200. I lived off rice and tomato paste until Christmas.</p><p>The rest of that day I spent in a foul and grudgeful mood, with most of my resentment focused on the figure of the man in the blue pullover. I don’t think I made much effort to consider that I had, in fact, been breaking the law. I didn’t consider that for society to function, pending the imminent workers’ utopia, people might have to pay for certain goods and services. I didn’t consider that I had grown up with more privilege than most, and that if I couldn’t afford a train fare it was because I’d chosen to spend my barmitzvah money on a postgraduate degree in the identity of identity and nonidentity. I was burning too hot for that sort of thought: this man was an image of everything I hated in the world. He had <em>enjoyed</em> it; he had <em>enjoyed</em> making my life worse as I begged him for some small shred of mercy. Our bad and unfree society hadn’t given him much power, but it had given him just enough to be cruel, and he had taken it. If I had been a different Jew, in a different time, on a different train, he would have herded me into the camps with the exact same look of neutral fastidiousness and the exact same secret pleasure. I knew exactly what to call this small, petty, hidebound nastiness. He was a <em>fascist</em>. I had come face to face with <em>fascism</em>.</p><p>I may have overreacted a little. But I still don’t think I was entirely wrong.</p><div><hr></div><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Five weeks ago, Italy gained a new Prime Minister. Giorgia Meloni is the leader of the Brothers of Italy party, which was founded in 2012 by former members of the National Alliance, which was founded in 1994 as a successor to the Italian Social Movement, which was founded in 1946 by former members of the Republican Fascist Party, which was founded in 1943 as a successor to the National Fascist Party, which had once exterminated entire towns in distant countries to build its new Roman Empire, and was founded in 1919 as a gang of a few hundred street thugs who would beat up striking workers at the behest of local industrialists. The logo of the Brothers of Italy is a flame, which supposedly symbolises the tomb of Mussolini. (This was also the logo of the Italian Social Movement, adopted because direct fascist imagery was banned after the war.) Mussolini’s own grandchildren are active in the party; some of its leaders have been known to flash the odd fascist salute.</p><p>Does this make them fascists? The Anglophone media, at least, seem to be fairly cautious on this point. Most outlets have played it safe, simply noting that this will be Italy’s most right-wing government since 1945, or that the Brothers of Italy have <em>roots</em> in neo-fascism, or that they’re on a nebulously defined <em>far-right</em>. Which seems odd: we’re constantly told that when fascism returns, it might not come brandishing the symbols and slogans of the 1930s. There might not be blackshirts again, or giant masks of the charismatic leader. It might claim to be something completely new. But here are the Brothers of Italy, draped in the legacy of the Salò Republic, and still we won’t use the word.</p><p>This is one position: that there’s a new form of right-wing populism on the march in Europe and around the world, that it sometimes has a direct line of descent, whether ideological or institutional, from the dictatorships of the last century, and we should simply call it what it is, which is fascism.</p><p>The other position points out that something really does appear to have changed between then and now. The Brothers of Italy did not win because the Italian people are demanding a dictatorship, but because they’re one of the only parties to have not joined the various unpopular technocratic unity governments that have overseen Italy’s terminal stagnation. Once, Italian politics was split between the Communists and the Christian Democrats, and democratic engagement was high: there was something at stake. Now, there’s a new populist party every few years; they come to power denouncing the compromises made by yesterday’s populist party, and change nothing; most people don’t vote; they can’t summon the will to care.</p><p>Even these populists are not quite like their ancestors. Gianfranco Fini started his political career as a teenager brawling with Communists in Bologna; in 1990 he declared, as the head of the Italian Social Movement, that ‘we are fascists, the heirs of fascism’—but by 2003 he was describing historical fascism as an ‘absolute evil.’ Did he actually mean it, or was he just trying to smooth over his image? It’s hard to tell. But when he made that comment, it was during a state visit to Israel, in his capacity as deputy prime minister of Italy.</p><p>The National Alliance and its successors have already been in and out of governing coalitions for nearly thirty years. In fact, their outsider branding is a sham; they are already part of the institution of the state. And while I don’t think any of those governments have been particularly <em>good</em>, they did not suspend parliamentary democracy or invade the Balkans. They were not a fascist dictatorship, and this one won’t be either. It can’t be: the world is a very different place. </p><p>Fascism, according to the second position, is not just a set of beliefs whirling around in someone’s head, an unkind attitude towards foreigners or a distaste for sexual minorities. If we’re going to <em>mean something</em> when we talk about fascism, we have to think of it as a particular set of relations between the state, society, and capital, one which came about under a very specific set of historical circumstances. Adam Tooze lists them:</p><blockquote><p>If we aim for is a general historical understanding of fascism, I would argue that we have to see it as shaped by three framing conditions. (1) the experience of total war; (2) the active threat of class war and revolution; (3) the shadow of the end of history as defined by the rise of Anglo-American global hegemony. All three contexts shaped both Mussolini and Hitler’s movements. We can relate to all three of these dimensions form the point of view of 2022, but in large part through difference and contrast rather than similarity of situation… The reason why it is ultimately fatuous to draw strong analogies between historic fascism and current right-wing movements is that the only true fascist is a dead fascist buried amidst the ruins of their regime.</p></blockquote><p>Maybe you could even talk about a specific fascist form of <em>language</em>. Umberto Eco opens his 1995 essay <em>Ur-Fascism</em> with an anecdote. When he was ten years old, he won a children’s essay-writing competition. The question set for the contest was ‘Should we die for the glory of Mussolini and the immortal destiny of Italy?’ He said that we should. ‘I was a smart boy.’ Italian fascism spoke in an epic, hysteric register: life and death, immortal destiny. Grandiose, yes, but <em>grand</em>. It did not sound like a ticket inspector explaining that you’ll have to pay a fine.</p><p>It also did not sound much like Giorgia Meloni. After her party’s victory, a speech of hers went briefly viral, cited approvingly by various right-wing US politicians. At the 2019 World Congress of Families, she’d complained:</p><blockquote><p>I can’t define myself as Italian, Christian, woman, mother. No. I must be Citizen X, Gender X, Parent 1, Parent 2. I must be a number. Because when I am only a number, when I no longer have an identity or roots, then I will be the perfect slave at the mercy of financial speculators. The perfect consumer. That’s why we inspire so much fear. That’s why this event inspires so much fear. Because we do not want to be numbers. We will defend the value of the human being, every single human being. Because each of us has a unique genetic code that is unrepeatable. And, like it or not, that is sacred.</p></blockquote><p>I have my own feelings on this, and they’re not entirely positive. (Who, exactly, told Meloni that she can’t define herself as a woman or a mother? Is she not aware that she can simply <em>ignore</em> people with postgraduate degrees in critical theory? And if human life is sacred because we each have a unique genetic code, does that mean identical twins are <em>less</em> sacred? Or are they sacred to a different, darker god? Should we maybe offer them up as sacrifices? Or just abandon them in the woods at birth?) Still, it’s worth noting that ‘we will defend the value of the human being, every single human being’ strikes a very different tone to ‘we should die for the glory of Mussolini and the immortal destiny of Italy.’ With its vague suspicion of consumer culture and its emphasis on the human individual, it sounds a lot, in fact, like the last generation’s mildly soppy liberalism.</p><div><hr></div><p>I’m not sure Eco himself would agree. In <em>Ur-Fascism</em>, he argues that fascism is <em>not</em>, in fact, a coherent political programme; it’s protean, always slightly formless. Mussolini was a fierce atheist whose followers terrorised Catholic priests, until he started getting cosy with the Pope and put a crucifix in every classroom. Fascism started as a republican movement, ‘yet it survived for twenty years proclaiming its loyalty to the royal family’—until 1943, when the king changed his mind and it suddenly preferred a republic again. It borrowed liberally from both left and right, picking and choosing drabs of ideology whenever the moment suited. </p><p>For Eco, fascism is not so particular, and it’s powered by something more shadowy than concrete circumstances or specific doctrines. ‘Behind a regime and its ideology there is always a way of thinking and feeling, a group of cultural habits, of obscure instincts and unfathomable drives.’ Eco calls this <em>Ur-Fascism</em>, a complex of affects that powered the dictatorships of the twentieth century, but which might also in the future power something <em>else</em>, something that is not quite the same thing as historical fascism, but which still flows from the same spring. He lists its attributes. A cult of tradition; a view of life as permanent and glorious warfare, crowned by a heroic death; a suspicion of critique, of difference, of foreigners, of thought in general… ‘These features cannot be organised into a system; many of them contradict each other, and are also typical of other kinds of despotism or fanaticism. But it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it.’</p><p>I think there’s something here, which we shouldn’t be too quick to dismiss. But when you start putting this stuff into practice—or applying one of the newer lists formulated by latter-day fascism-discerners like Yale’s Jason Stanley—you very quickly get stuck.</p><p>Here’s an example. Nearly four years ago, the late Barbara Ehrenreich made an unpopular remark online. ‘I will be convinced that America is not in decline only when our de-cluttering guru Marie Kondo learns to speak English.’ She <em>meant</em> that Kondo speaking only Japanese on TV was the index of a loss of cultural hegemony; she wasn’t making any kind of claim about whether this was good or bad. It didn’t matter; there was an instant uproar, and it lasted weeks. Get out Eco’s list, see item five. ‘Ur-Fascism grows up and seeks for consensus by exploiting and exacerbating the natural <em>fear of difference</em>. The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders.’ Also consider item seven. ‘At the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the <em>obsession with a plot</em>, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged.’ America in decline; foreigners are speaking their foreign languages on our screens, coming into our homes, taking away our <em>stuff…</em> It’s sad, but we have to face the facts: one of the greatest socialist intellectuals of our era has crossed the line and become a fascist.</p><p>Except—what about all the people on the <em>other side</em>, the ones trying to punish Ehrenreich? Item four: ‘No syncretistic faith can withstand analytical criticism… for Ur-Fascism, disagreement is treason.’ And there was a clearly discernable impulse to make a particular example out of Ehrenreich here, not <em>despite</em> the fact that she was a widely-revered left-wing figure, but precisely <em>because</em> of it; to show everyone how thin the line is between <em>us</em> and <em>them</em>, and that nobody is safe from becoming one of <em>them</em>. And what about Marie Kondo herself? Kondo’s tidying-up philosophy is inspired by traditional Shinto spiritualism, which sounds nice, but then so was the official state ideology of Imperial Japan. Every object has a soul, and like all souls the souls of your possessions tend towards their rightful path. A place for everything and everything in its place. A regimented, hierarchical world in which nothing is allowed to deviate from its essence. No contaminants. No <em>clutter</em>. Do the Jews spark joy? This one didn’t make Umberto Eco’s list. But maybe it should have.</p><div><hr></div><p>Still, you can’t get away with describing just <em>anything</em> as fascism. Let’s look at one more Italian. Back when I was a student, I wrote my dissertation on Samuel Beckett’s <em>Molloy</em>, which I read through the philosophy of Giorgio Agamben. My supervisor thought this was a very good idea. ‘Agamben’s very trendy right now,’ he said. Agamben is not quite so trendy any more. Much of this has to do with the positions he started adopting during the covid pandemic: that the virus might not really exist, that the vaccines are not guaranteed to be safe, and that the public health measures—lockdowns, quarantines, contact tracing, vaccine passes—amounted to a form of ‘techno-medical despotism.’ Most damningly, he wrote that they were also a kind of <em>fascism</em>. ‘The ‘green card’ constitutes those who do not have it as bearers of a virtual yellow star.’ That was the final straw. To compare vaccine mandates to the Holocaust was deeply, deeply offensive. Agamben’s former collaborators, translators, and students lined up to denounce him. Some of them noted that his recent comments had won him praise from Italy’s far right: in denouncing the covid restrictions as fascist, Agamben seemed to be heading towards a kind of fascism himself. But then these critics had to perform a strange manoeuvre. They couldn’t just say that Agamben had taken a bad <em>turn</em>, or betrayed his own intellectual legacy; they had to announce that actually, his thought had been compromised from the very beginning. Because describing things as fascist is basically his entire deal.</p><p>Agamben is a Schmittian, in the sense that his project is to situate Nazi legal theory within the broader history of European jurisprudence. But while Schmitt was trying to <em>justify</em> the Nazis’ unlimited exercise of power, Agamben was trying to <em>critique</em> European jurisprudence. For Agamben, the entire Western theory of sovereignty formed the road to Auschwitz; any exercise of power is of a piece with fascism. So he compares a lot of things to the Holocaust. The concentration camps form a ‘biopolitical paradigm of the modern’ or ‘the new biopolitical <em>nomos</em> of the planet;’ he sees the Final Solution in the bureaucratic processing of migrants, in euthanasia, in medical experimentation, in car accidents. He told the world that it was already living under fascism, that fascism formed the most basic substance of all political life in liberal-democratic societies, and we clapped like seals and decided that he was very trendy. But then, when those same liberal democracies started exercising control over whether people could leave their homes or who they could publicly associate with, when they started sorting society into the clean and the potential disease-carriers, when they justified it through the state’s natural interest in matters of biological life and death, and when he described that as fascism too—suddenly we were outraged.</p><p>As it happens, I think Agamben might have been overreacting here; you might have noticed that there was not, in the end, a permanent covid biosecurity state. Still, it’s very odd that anyone would upbraid <em>Giorgio Agamben</em> for not appreciating that thanks to the virus, we were in an unavoidable stte of exception. It’s worth asking: why was it ok to describe liberal society <em>in general</em> as essentially fascist in nature, but <em>not</em> ok to say the same about just one particular feature of that society? Or, to put it another way, what does describing something or someone as fascist actually <em>do</em>?</p><p>Strangely, the one thing it <em>doesn’t</em> do is add any new information—or even, in most cases, any particular insight. When people get out their checklists, they’re basing their judgements on the things we already know; the facts are rarely in dispute, it’s just a question of deciding whether to apply the epithet. But whether or not you describe Giorgia Meloni (or Viktor Orbán, or Donald Trump, or Peter Thiel, or the censorious woke left, or the entire population of Ukraine, or whoever) as fascist, she still has exactly the same basic ideology, with exactly the same positions on migrants and queer people and everything else. It’s odd: this huge, totemic word doesn’t seem to change anything at all.</p><p>Calling something fascist only has the form of an <em>is</em>-statement; in fact, it’s one about <em>oughts</em>. Applying the epithet doesn’t usually make the world more legible, but it does impose a certain <em>responsibility</em> on everyone else. Fascism, in a liberal society, is that which<em> delenda est</em>. If a person is a fascist, they must be opposed by every possible means, even violent ones. If a political movement is fascist, we need to flood the streets and oppose it. If Italy is now ruled by fascists, then perhaps we ought to go to war. Send our tanks over the Alps, fire a few cruise missiles to turn their smug duomos into rubble, maybe mount another amphibious landing in Sicily and fight our way up the peninsula, inch by bloody inch.</p><p>This might be why the argument that Meloni is <em>not</em> a fascist so often hinges on her (grudging) support for the EU and (enthusiastic) support for NATO. If Italy is remaining very much geopolitically <em>on side</em>, if we will <em>not</em> be going to war with them, their government must therefore not be a fascist one. Of course, anyone who knows Italian history will know that NATO has been very willing to work with Italian fascists in the past. But since fascism is simply the thing that ‘we’ have to fight, saying that ‘we’ might also be in some way fascist becomes a contradiction: nonsensical, and therefore harmless. You can say that liberal society is fascist to the core, if you like. Knock yourself out. Just don’t ever get too specific.</p><div><hr></div><p>Is there a better way of talking about fascism? Is there a way of naming something as fascist, or seeing the points of continuity between our present-day reality and the nightmares of the past, that doesn’t just resolve into <em>fuck that guy</em>? Maybe. I’ve changed my mind on this subject quite a few times, and written a few essays on fascism that flatly contradict each other. But where I’ve ended up, for the moment, is here: fascism is not a question of an individual’s ideological positions or nasty prejudices, swimming around in the wet stuff of the brain, untethered from history, but it’s also not a specific historical form that existed only in the early twentieth century, never to be repeated. Its domain is not the objective world at large, or the grimiest pits of the human heart: it’s both, in the interplay between them.</p><p>In the end, it all comes back to that man in the blue pullover.</p><p>I think Eco was onto something when he found the source of fascism in ‘obscure instincts and unfathomable drives.’ But when he actually listed those instincts and drives, what he came up with was, in the end, still too propositional, too close to the surface. The most basic raw material of fascist movements isn’t the cult of tradition or a syncretic approach to history; it’s petty, peevish, grudgeful vengeance. It’s the secret joys of faceless bureaucracies.</p><p>That ticket inspector could inflict some small suffering on other people, and he was enjoying it. But he didn’t have the power to inflict suffering all by <em>himself</em>. To get what he wanted, he had to act as if he didn’t want anything at all: he had to surrender his human existence to the blank enforcement of the rules, become a living vessel for the corporate interests of Govia Ltd—and he was <em>loving</em> it. This is a liberation, of a sort, and a transgression, but a mimetic one. It’s sadism, but not the Promethean sadism you might find in the actual Marquis de Sade. ‘How many times, by God, have I longed to be able to assail the sun, snatch it out of the universe, make a general darkness, or use that star to burn the world! Oh, that would be a crime.’ Sade’s heroes were monsters, but they were not fascists. (And while Stalin was an ordinary sexual sadist, Hitler was not. He was a naughty little Führer who wanted to be tied up and punished.) The core of fascism is not a desire for power; it’s a desire for <em>permission</em>. For a structure that could let you cary out your small acts of revenge, while you can claim to just be following orders.</p><p>This stuff is all around us; you will probably encounter it every day of your life. Most of the time, it does not lead to major acts of genocide. For that, you need a political movement, and the right set of historical circumstances to drown out any other affect. That’s what the fascist dictatorships of the past did: they were nothing more than that same impulse, raised to the level of an all-encompassing state ideology. Even the grand style of fascism was only the small man’s resentment, amplified. ‘Die for the glory of Mussolini and the immortal destiny of Italy!’ Annihilate yourself, and love it! Die in some apocalyptic war, to be reborn as an abstract principle—so you can finally get your own back against the upstairs neighbours who hold loud parties past midnight and keep putting their recycling in the main bin! Sometimes in old B-movies an ordinary insect will wander into the path of the magnification ray and grow into a monster, crushing entire cities with a sweep of its chitinous limbs, shrugging off nuclear bombs. But it’s still an insect: a thing that crawls aroud in gutters and under leaves.</p><p>Here’s the problem, though. Back when I had my encounter with that ticket inspector, I was also a petty, grudgeful man. I was broke and living in squalor; my life had disappointed me in a way I couldn’t quite describe, as if someone was cheating me out of it, and I wanted revenge. I was waiting for the grand upheaval that would let me indulge in all my least admirable impulses. If someone had come up to me that day promoting a political platform in which all bothersome bureaucrats would be put on a deserted island and then quietly killed, I would have signed up in a second. Reading <em>Minima Moralia</em> had not protected me. I was not immune then, and I’m not immune now.</p><div><hr></div><p>A lot of leftists like to adopt the Reichian line that there is a fascist-in-waiting in all of us, that we’re all potentially susceptible to its allure. ‘There is today not a single individual who does not have the elements of fascist feeling and thinking in his structure.’ But in practice, when we talk about the risk of collapsing into fascism, we mean having right-wing opinions: going over to the <em>other side</em>. (Actually, it often just means explicit white nationalism, which is a strangely narrow horizon.) And yes, the peevishness that expressed itself in historical fascism does still find a comfy home on the right. Is Giorgia Meloni a fascist? Probably, yes! A country in decline, a whole continent mouldering, an enemy that wants to surgically remove your daughter’s tits… Her party barely even pretends that it could change anything; it’s all gesture, a symbolic strike against the international elite that’s making the ordinary people miserable. But in a world in which <em>everyone</em> is frustrated and unhappy, and <em>every</em> political movement advertises itself as a chance to inflict punishments on your enemies, where you can always explain away your own cruelties by pointing to the other side’s, and fascism is not a coherent politics but a black and deep desire, what are <em>you</em>?</p><p>A friend of mine is an antifascist. She is deeply, deeply concerned by the question of whether, if she were alive during the Holocaust, she would have risked her life by hiding Jews in her home. Most people, I think, assume that because they’re against the Holocaust <em>now</em>, they would have done this <em>then</em>, and they vaguely pat themselves on the back for preventing an entirely notional genocide. But for my friend, it’s a very live question. <em>Am I now, in this moment, acting in the same way as the person who would have hid Jews from the Nazis?</em> Part of how this manifests itself is an absolute principled refusal to join in on the game of imposing consequences on the justified target of the day, because the people targeted by fascism are always, in some sense, justified targets. ‘Mistrust all those in whom the urge to punish is strong. And when they call themselves the good and the just, do not forget that they would be pharisees, if only they had—power.’ For this, her name was basically unmentionable in certain lefty circles for several years.</p><p>Theodor Adorno, famously, thought that everything was fascism. He simply did not believe that with the Allied victory in the war the danger had passed and the liberal-democratic world was safe from another Auschwitz. Hence his wails against the fascism of mass entertainment, cockails, restaurants, and slippers. He even did his own version of Agamben’s deeply offensive comparison in <em>The Essay as Form</em>, way back in 1958. ‘The person who interprets instead of unquestioningly accepting and categorising is slapped with the charge of intellectualising as if with a yellow star.’ It’s not just the Holocaust when states start exercising full biopolitical control over their populations; it’s the Holocaust whenever someone thinks his essays are a bit fussy and overwrought. </p><p>But this was a person who took the horrors of fascism <em>seriously</em>, and who was serious about not allowing them to happen again. This led him towards some stances which are extremely unfashionable among antifascists now. There was a fascist potential in the student movements of the 1960s. There was a fascist potential in factionalism of all kinds. ‘Whoever is engaged in praxis, as it is called, is pursuing interests, is realizing plans, automatically turns the human beings they come into contact with into friends and enemies… This manner of reaction however, the schema of all administration and ‘personnel policy,’ already tends, before any political formation of will and commitment of exclusive political tickets, towards fascism.’ In 1944, before the war had even ended, when he went to the cinema to watch the heroic struggle against fascism, he saw it triumphant:</p><blockquote><p>Weekly show at the movies: the invasion of the Marianas, among them Guam. The impression is not one of battles, but of mechanical highway and demolition work undertaken with an immeasurably increased vehemence, even of ‘fumigation,’ pest control on a telluric scale. Operations are carried out until grass no longer grows. The enemy functions as patient and corpse. Like the Jews under Fascism, he appears only as the object of technical-administrative measures, and when he defends himself, his counter-actions have the same character. Therein is the Satanic element, that to a certain extent this war requires more initiative than war in the old style, that it costs the subject all its energy, as it were, to achieve subjectlessness.</p></blockquote>

It works like this. Say you’re an annoying and unpleasant person who spends too much time online—which, if you’re reading this, is probably true. You waste your life posting your preferred brand of nonsense, rambling about vaccines or the shadow state or other things the mainstream media doesn’t want anyone to know about, until eventually your outbursts reach the attention of someone important. Suddenly, your experience of the internet is transformed. At first you get a handful of new followers a day, then dozens, then hundreds. They leave comments fulsomely agreeing with you, laughing at all your jokes, praising you as the greatest and most fearless mind of your generation. Sometimes people pop up who dare to question your wisdom, but their arguments fall apart like wet paper, and eventually they’re forced to grudgingly accept that you were right all along. The world revolves around you and your brilliant opinions. Maybe you should run for office. Maybe you should run for <em>king</em>. The only problem is that none of your new admirers actually exist. The heavenbanned are totally invisible to all other users on their chosen platform; no human being will read anything they post ever again. Instead, you live in a little virtual internet populated entirely by AIs, who exist only to give you the most narcissistically satisfying online experience possible. At the moment, heavenbanning is just a concept—supposedly. Maybe it already exists. Maybe you’ve been heavenbanned yourself. If you were—how could you tell?</p><p>Another question: would being heavenbanned count as an infringement of your free speech?</p><p>On the face of it, no. The heavenbanned can still say absolutely anything they want. If anything, they have <em>more</em> latitude than the rest of us—they don’t have to worry about any of the social sanctions that punish everyone else for saying things that are too cruel or stupid or unhinged. They can churn out as many death threats and racial slurs as they want, and receive only praise. But at the same time, this is obviously not enough. Imagine the grey, rainy, totalitarian society of your nightmares; let’s call it Belgium. In this ‘Belgium,’ the all-encompassing coalition government graciously allows you to say whatever you like about its Supreme Leader, Alexander De Croo—but only as long as you do it in a special soundproofed room in your drab concrete apartment block, and only if no one sees you enter or leave. You can even write an impassioned denunciation of his Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten party, just so long as you make sure to burn it afterwards. Are the Belgians enjoying their freedom?</p><p>Borges’ short story <em>The Secret Miracle</em> concerns Jaromir Hladik, a Czech writer struggling to complete his masterwork, a drama in verse called <em>The Enemies</em>. Unfortunately for Hladik, time is running out: the year is 1939, the Nazis have just taken Prague, and Hladik is Jewish. The occupying army arrest him, and alone and desperate in his cell Hladik prays to God to let him live just one more year so he can finish his play. But the next day the soldiers lead him out behind the prison and give him a cigarette. The soldiers raise their guns, their commander gives the order to fire, and time freezes. God, or something like God, has granted Hladik’s prayer: one year of subjective time. In that year, he arranges and rearranges the lines in his head, memorising them all. Finally the play is complete, and it’s perfect, even if it exists only in his mind. Then time resumes, the German soldiers shoot, and that mind is suddenly extinguished. This is enough for Hladik. Would it be enough for you?</p><p>People like to talk a lot about this thing, <em>free speech</em>, but without giving too much thought to what it actually <em>is</em>. Instead, what we usually get are a few warmed-over little phrases. <em>Free speech is not hate speech</em>. <em>Free speech is not free reach</em>. <em>Free speech is not freedom from consequences</em>. Fine—but what is it, then? Sometimes you get a glimpse of what it might be through the opposing terms: free speech has to be weighted against the potential for <em>harm</em>, or <em>offence</em>, or <em>disinformation</em>, or sometimes even <em>Nazism</em>. But since a hundred years ago, the dangers of free speech were different—<em>revolt</em>, or <em>Bolshevism</em>—I’m not sure how much this teaches us. I don’t like to talk too much about him or his platform, but Elon Musk is a useful example: when he first took over Twitter, he announced that his new version of the website would be the shield of freedom against tyranny—before eventually clarifying that free speech obviously didn’t include such outrages as parody, impersonation, links to competing platforms, statements that Mr Musk happened to dislike, and, finally, statements made by people who hadn’t paid him an appropriate fee.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> In 1994, Stanley Fish wrote that free speech ‘is not an independent value but a political prize.’ Ideological factions invoke some hazy principle of free speech when they want to spread their particular brand of propaganda and other people don’t want to listen. As soon as the situation changes, they discard it. The argument seems to be that freedom of speech doesn’t really exist, because people will sometimes disregard it; I’m not sure this holds.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> But a lot of people seem intent on proving him right.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> </p><p>I think that most of the time when we talk about freedom of speech, what we really mean is <em>the right to be heard</em>. Anyone <em>can</em> say anything; they always could. There has never been any society so authoritarian that it could effectively prevent people speaking or writing the things it disliked. What repressive forces <em>can</em> do is limit the safe <em>distribution</em> of certain kinds of speech.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a> But if you want to uphold this particular right, things get very tricky. Once, the right to be heard would mean that you could wander into the village square and start ranting to anyone in earshot without being molested. The people who might potentially hear you were the people who were physically <em>near</em> you; if you can reach them, then you are free. Today, with digital communications, the number of people who might potentially hear you is <em>everyone</em>, or as close to everyone as makes no difference. If your little insights don’t go out to absolutely every human being on the planet, then your rights are being infringed. This is why it’s held to be a potential free speech issue when a TV show is cancelled or a social media account is banned, even though you can still technically <em>speak</em> without either. Totally free speech, therefore, would mean everyone being permanently plugged in to the nightmare cacophony of eight billion chattering mouths, all talking at the same time, overlapping idiocies at a pitch and modulation that would very rapidly turn all our brains into a brief gush of goo escaping through our nostrils. We can do this! The technology exists. The results might not be desirable. But anything less puts us on the dangerous slope to heavenbanning.</p><p>Except, of course, that even then we would still not be fully free. If your individual freedom of speech is only realised in being heard by <em>other people</em>, you’re faced with quite a serious problem. You can’t, in fact, speak however you like; you have to speak in a particular way that will allow other people to understand you. You have to use <em>language</em>—and language is, in the end, something you <em>submit </em>yourself to.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a> Psychoanalysis is pretty clear on this point: when we come into language, it’s because we have been defeated and castrated; we have finally given up our dreams of full phallic potency and the joyful immediacy of the object. Afterwards, you learn to speak in words you did not choose; you accept a symbolic order that structures your life on all sides. Using words means accepting the greater power of the father and accepting that you are not free. The only truly free speech belongs to <em>babies</em>. So in fact, a regime of total freedom would be a planet in which everyone is communicating the inner contents of their minds with perfect and immediate urgency—which would mean constantly screaming, at the top of your lungs, all the time. In which all of existence consists of hearing and joining the universal wail. A planet of animal-men, pigs on their hind legs, grunting and squealing, maybe building huge radio arrays to broadcast our agony into every corner of outer space. </p><p>But this isn’t too different from where we started. It’s hard to imagine that on hogworld, there would be anyone really <em>listening</em>.</p><p>All this might sound like I’m trying to trash the notion of free speech altogether: like I’m slowly leading you to the argument that we really do need some kind of censorship, we need sensible restrictions on what you can and can’t say, to avoid descending into hogworld. I am not. In fact, I am a free speech absolutist. But if we’re going to take free speech <em>seriously</em>, we have to start thinking about it outside the forms given to us by people like Elon Musk.</p><div><hr></div><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Most people do not think of the necessity of speaking in language as an impediment to free speech. But I still think it’s a useful model of how a very different kind of restriction works.</p><p>Usually, it’s taken for granted that free speech as a principle is opposed to some kind of censor, a <em>gag</em> that prevents your grunts and squeals from going out into the world. Sometimes this censor is held to be bad and tyrannical; sometimes it’s the only thing that makes a democratic society possible—but it’s always there. And these censors do exist. Personally, I’m not fond of them. Regardless of the ideological excuses they gussy themselves up with, they usually strike me—not least, on a purely personal level—as nasty hysterical little busybodies,<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" target="_self">6</a> and as a communist it is my sincere hope that one day we will be able to round them all up and help them build a life rich enough in meaning that they no longer feel the need to keep sticking their noses in other people’s business. Still, censorship is only a very particular <em>form</em> of unfreedom in speech, and one that’s less and less significant with every passing day.</p><p>Look, for instance, at the university, which is one of the major battlegrounds in our modern free-speech wars. In our universities, we’re regularly informed, things are not going well. In California, a professor was suspended after briefly discussing the Chinese word <em>nèi ge</em>, which functions like <em>um</em> or <em>uh</em> in English. Students complained: ‘The way we heard it in class was indicative [<em>sic</em>] of a much more hurtful word with tremendous implications [<em>sic</em>] for the Black community. There are over 10,000 characters in the Chinese written language and to use this phrase, a clear synonym [<em>sic</em>] with this derogatory n-word term [<em>sic</em>], is hurtful and unacceptable.’ In Minnesota, a lecturer included, as part of the materials for her course on the history of Islamic art, an illustration from the fourteenth-century <em>Jami' al-Tawarikh</em> of Rashid al-Din, showing Mohammed being visited by the angel Jibril. This image was pious enough for the court of Mahmud Ghazan, but not for the university’s administrators; she was fired. We have finally discovered what is eternally good and true.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7" target="_self">7</a> The university’s president wrote: ‘Respect for the observant Muslim students in that classroom should have superseded academic freedom.’ And so on. There are hundreds more.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8" href="#footnote-8" target="_self">8</a> This stuff is real, and also really stupid. But the people who spend their lives fighting against it tend to make a very strange assumption: that all of this is deeply inimical to the founding principles of the university as an institution, which are the Enlightenment doctrines of free enquiry and freedom of thought.</p><p>But the university is <em>not</em> an institution of the Enlightenment. There are two major globe-spanning institutions around today that have their roots in the Middle Ages. One is capitalism. The other is the university. </p><p>The medieval university was founded on a principle of freedom of thought, but not in the way we understand it today. The entire point of the university was to stamp out heterodox opinions: instead of allowing freelance scholars to provide instruction for a fee, universities formalised and centralised education under the watchful eye of the Church. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, over fifty academics were prosecuted for heresy, often by their own colleagues. Masters of theology were put in place to condemn their underlings, which is what happened to Amalric of Bena and Etienne of Venizy. David of Dinant outlined a pantheistic philosophy in his <em>Quaternuli</em>; afterwards, his books were burned, anyone found in possession of them was declared a heretic, and David had to flee Paris to die in obscurity. Medieval academic freedom was not about the <em>content</em> of thought, but its <em>shape</em>: its model was the <em>quodlibet</em>, the totally open, unbounded, free-flowing disputation, flitting indifferently from one arena of knowledge to another. A mode of thought that moves by itself, and is free. Contemporary academics can now espouse a pantheistic philosophy if they want, and nobody will burn their books because of it. But even if the quodlibetical mode isn’t formally forbidden, it’s become all but impossible. </p><p>The problem isn’t that academics are prevented from speaking; they have been <em>condemned</em> to speak. Early-career academics are rigorously assessed by the number of publications they produce: to play the game, you have to churn out more and more research in your own tightly specialised field, and most of this material is bullshit. The people writing it know it’s bullshit; the people publishing it know it’s bullshit; the people making assessments based on it know it’s bullshit. In the sciences, this pressure to publish is a major contributing factor in the ongoing replication crisis, in which it’s been discovered that a vast chunk of all scientific studies simply don’t hold up: our knowledge-producing apparatus is now producing overwhelming quantities of junk. In the humanities, it’s led to vast piles of frantic, worthless, and sometimes borderline-illiterate verbiage. In total, the world’s universities produce nearly two million journal articles per year—but with everyone busy frantically writing their own, who has the time to <em>read</em> any of it? The average peer-reviewed article is read by only ten people—but this average is actually pushed up significantly by a tiny number of works at the very top of the power-law distribution. Around half of all published academic work is read by exactly <em>two</em> people: the author, and the peer reviewer.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-9" href="#footnote-9" target="_self">9</a> Still, despite it all, you have to be seen to keep producing this worthless blather to keep your job.</p><p>The university is already an enormous exercise in heavenbanning: you can say anything you like, but nobody will ever hear you, even if you’re constantly showered in praise. It is already hogworld: a frenzied overproduction of noise. The ability to stop, and think, and reflect, and do the slow deliberate work of speaking with genuine <em>intention</em> is dying out. There is no censorship involved. Nothing is ever forbidden. But isn’t this <em>also</em> a serious threat to free expression?</p><div><hr></div><p>Today, what makes us unfree is not the blanking-out of words, but opaque systems of incentives that <em>compel</em> us to speak under conditions not of our own choosing. Under these conditions, freedom as a category is becoming less and less coherent. <em>Quodlibet</em> means, loosely, <em>whatever you want</em>: this is a kind of speech whose only limits are language, reason, and desire. For the Middle Ages, when censorship was much more overt and active than it is today, this would have been a fairly simple criterion: if you have a space to say what you want, then your speech is free. Today, we are all somewhere in the bowels of a vast mechanism dedicated to <em>manipulating</em> our desires. Does it matter if you can say what you want, if <em>what you want</em> is already chosen for you? </p><p>This manipulation doesn’t need to be deliberate or directed; most of the time it happens all by itself. It’s also not unique to our era, even if we’ve managed to generate it on an industrial scale. Once, desire was manipulated through the family, and propaganda, and the state; now, much of the work has been outsourced to the other great battleground of our free speech wars, which is the internet.</p><p>A few weeks ago, the people behind this particular online platform decided to cook up a new social media network, which happened to eerily resemble Twitter. For the first few days, Substack Notes was populated entirely by the sort of people who write about crypto, all flatulently patting themselves on the back for how sane and peaceful they were being online. Then, very shortly afterwards, some users started calling each other bloodsucking Jews, and others started demanding that any user who called anyone else bloodsucking Jew should be kicked off the platform, and absolutely everyone seemed hellbent on being as crazy and aggressive as is humanly possible. As far as I know, they’re still at it. In an interview with the <em>Verge</em>, Substack’s CEO was repeatedly asked whether a user would be banned for posting that ‘all brown people are animals and they shouldn’t be allowed in America,’ and repeatedly refused to answer. The choice in front of us, when it comes to online censorship—or moderation, or whatever you want to call it—is supposedly <em>hogworld or heavenbanning</em>. You can go down the free-speech route, which will inevitably mean rolling around in the muck of the human id with the abusers and the bigots, everyone screaming, everyone tearing chunks out of each other’s flesh. Or you can demand a sanitised, compartmentalised existence, in which everything that might potentially discomfort you is hidden away, every experience is lovely and frictionless, but all you ever see is a blank reflection of yourself.</p><p>Obviously, this is a false choice. However they’re moderated, online spaces can only give you one thing, which is <em>both of these</em> at the same time. The sadism and nastiness is a direct product of the fact that on the internet you’re never engaging with actual <em>people</em>, but always figments on a screen.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-10" href="#footnote-10" target="_self">10</a> Each side of the free speech-vs-moderation debate was advocating for one of the different moving parts in a single process.</p><p>Substack’s social-media experiment curtailed the freedom of speech in a much more fundamental way than any system of censorship ever could. Like seemingly everyone who tried out the thing, I soon discovered that using it caused my subscriber count to tick up dramatically. Since this platform now provides a non-negligible chunk of my income (if you’re reading this, thank you for buying my dinners and participating in the self-debasement of my soul), I had an obvious incentive to put more and more stuff on there. I had to post the sort of things that would generate more engagement. I had to relentlessly flood this hole with words. In what sense, then, could anything I said there be said <em>freely</em>? If anything, my freedom demanded that I forbid myself from ever touching the thing again.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-11" href="#footnote-11" target="_self">11</a> </p><p>Every social media platform is the same: for the things you say to <em>be heard</em> effectively, you have to optimise yourself. Expressions that are easily legible to the machine get engagement; those that aren’t threaten to tip you back into anonymity. You become a caricature. You might think you’re saying whatever you want, but <em>what you want</em> has become quietly identical with what the machine wants of you. This is why it’s so absurd for these platforms to intermittently announce their commitment to fighting disinformation, or for users to demand they do more; <em>everything posted there</em> is disinformation. If you're on Instagram, you spread disinformation about how happy you are and how beautiful your life is. If you're on Twitter, you spread disinformation about how you're a victim and miserable and broken and aggrieved. If you’re on TikTok, you can do both. Either way, the system speaks its lies out your mouth. Whatever this is, it’s nothing like freedom.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-12" href="#footnote-12" target="_self">12</a></p><p>The young Karl Marx’s first published work was a series of essays for the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> on the freedom of the press. You should read it; it’s not long. (I’ve quoted some of it in the footnotes here.) Marx was, as you’d expect, not a fan of state censorship; he devotes most of his time to brilliantly, biliously demolishing all the limp pieties of the anxious and the outraged. But in his final salvo, he turns everything around. Some of his fellow critics of state censorship have argued that the freedom of the press is just a species of <em>freedom of trade</em>: writers and editors, just like any other tradesmen, should be able to carry on their business without undue interference from the powers that be. Marx disagrees. Freedom of the press, for him, is in fact just a particular application of human freedom <em>as such</em>, or the ‘<em>freedom without any specific name</em>.’ A true freedom of the press would not be the right of every writer to earn his crust scribbling whatever is rewarded by the market in its great open whorehouse of thoughts and words. Instead, ‘<em>the primary freedom of the press lies in not being a trade</em>. The writer who degrades the press into being a material means deserves as punishment for this internal unfreedom the external unfreedom of censorship, or rather his very existence is his punishment.’<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-13" href="#footnote-13" target="_self">13</a></p><p>Today we might say: freedom of speech on the internet would be the freedom of speech <em>from</em> the internet. You are not unfree because you have been censored. You have been censored because you are <em>already unfree</em>. And being able to speak <em>more</em>, heard by more people, will not change that. You have become a screaming pigman on a planetary factory-farm of eight billion hapless screaming pigmen. Your only freedom is to scream—and now you want someone to silence the other creatures, so your screams can carry further. But the choice between screaming and strangulation is not a choice, and the real freedom would be the freedom of <em>not having to scream</em>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b7aec5-0975-48e9-aa7e-9018d4e6fdd2_1150x838.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b7aec5-0975-48e9-aa7e-9018d4e6fdd2_1150x838.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b7aec5-0975-48e9-aa7e-9018d4e6fdd2_1150x838.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b7aec5-0975-48e9-aa7e-9018d4e6fdd2_1150x838.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b7aec5-0975-48e9-aa7e-9018d4e6fdd2_1150x838.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b7aec5-0975-48e9-aa7e-9018d4e6fdd2_1150x838.jpeg" width="1150" height="838" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/16b7aec5-0975-48e9-aa7e-9018d4e6fdd2_1150x838.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:838,&quot;width&quot;:1150,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:901968,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b7aec5-0975-48e9-aa7e-9018d4e6fdd2_1150x838.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b7aec5-0975-48e9-aa7e-9018d4e6fdd2_1150x838.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b7aec5-0975-48e9-aa7e-9018d4e6fdd2_1150x838.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b7aec5-0975-48e9-aa7e-9018d4e6fdd2_1150x838.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>This a familiar pattern. Matt Bruenig writes about his encounter with the works of the ‘lunatic libertarian’ Hans-Harmann Hoppe:</p><blockquote><p>Triple H managed to convince a lot of people that he had come up with a clever new argument for libertarianism that he called Argumentation Ethics. According to Argumentation Ethics, the entire libertarian worldview on property is a necessary precondition for free speech and deliberation and therefore it is always contradictory to argue (i.e. use free speech and deliberation) against that worldview. In his later books, Triple H unsurprisingly outlined an ideal libertarian utopia in which all speech that was counter to the foundations of a free society would be punished by exile. That included anyone speaking against property rights, but also, for him, people speaking in favor of other things that he believed undermined the preconditions for freedom including various ‘alternative lifestyle’ habits.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-2" href="#footnote-anchor-2" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">2</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Marx: ‘The Assembly discusses liberation of the press from its bonds.

It’s necessary to allow people to write and publish freely, Milton insists, even if what they write is not good or not true, because it’s only by comparison that you can work out <em>what the truth is</em>:</p><blockquote><p>What wisdome can there be to choose, what continence to forbeare without the knowledge of evill? He that can apprehend and consider vice with all her baits and seeming pleasures, and yet abstain, and yet distinguish, and yet prefer that which is truly better, he is the true wayfaring Christian. I cannot praise a fugitive and cloister'd vertue, unexercis'd &amp; unbreath'd, that never sallies out and sees her adversary, but slinks out of the race, where that immortall garland is to be run for, not without dust and heat. Assuredly we bring not innocence into the world, we bring impurity much rather: that which purifies us is triall, and triall is by what is contrary. That vertue therefore which is but a youngling in the contemplation of evill, and knows not the utmost that vice promises to her followers, and rejects it, is but a blank vertue, not a pure.</p></blockquote><p>This is the same general line that was taken up by Mill, and Kant, and all the other liberal heroes (even Marx): if rational minds are given the freedom to work things out for themselves, they will eventually alight on the truth; this is the <em>only</em> way of eventually alighting on the truth. For reasons that should be obvious, this has not worked, and it will never work. As Fish points out, even Milton felt the need to carve out some exceptions. ‘I mean not tolerated Popery, and open superstition, which as it extirpats all religions and civill supremacies, so it self should be extirpat: that also which is impious or evil absolutely either against faith or maners no law can possibly permit.’ Once you think you’ve found a few things that are unquestionably good and true, the whole process is already completed; it’s easy to decide that you no longer need a falsehood to test it against. Which suggests that if we’re <em>genuinely</em> interested in open expression, we need to get off this track altogether. Maybe a <em>real</em> freedom would not be freedom in the cause of anything as minor and petty as truth. It would be the greatest freedom, without which everything else is just a blind compulsion towards facts—which is the <em>right to be wrong</em>.</p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-4" href="#footnote-anchor-4" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">4</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Marx: ‘<em>There are no actual preventive laws</em>.

A few years ago, posters started appearing on the walls of my own alma mater, the University of Sussex, that read: ‘WE’RE NOT PAYING £9250 A YEAR FOR TRANSPHOBIA—FIRE KATHLEEN STOCK.’ I don't think it's any kind of commentary on Professor Stock’s work to point out that this is a bad and unworthy demand. I arrived at Sussex a few months after the end of the ‘Sussex Five’ affair, in which five students were banned from campus after occupying a building to protest the outsourcing of university services to an exploitative, profit-seeking private contractor. Once, the idea was that the university ought to be a place that worked differently to the rest of the economy: a place dedicated to knowledge, and not the exchange of money for services. That was the idea that animated my generation of student radicals—but we failed. Sussex liked to trade on its radical history; in fact, it had become one of the most thoroughly neoliberalised universities in the country. And now, insead of contesting that shift, student activism is conditined by it. The protesters position themselves as irate <em>customers</em>. They’re paying money for this education, so they should get to decide who educates them and how. If an employee isn’t to their liking, that employee needs to go. Which means the demand is always for <em>more</em> bureaucratic control over the life of the campus and the life of the intellect, and never less.</p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-9" href="#footnote-anchor-9" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">9</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Prophesised by Marx: ‘You Germans can only express yourselves at great length!

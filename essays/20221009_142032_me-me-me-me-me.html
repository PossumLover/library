I duly hammered out the piece and sent it off, and a while later my editor got in touch to tell me that actually, having read the thing, he wouldn’t be able to publish it. </p><p>You can relax: I promise I’m not taking this in the usual direction. I do not think that the piece I wrote was <em>too controversial</em>, too <em>radical</em>, too <em>heterodox</em>, or that I was being <em>censored</em> for my wild and dangerous opinions on these little nubs of language. I’m not even saying his decision was unfair. (Anyone who’s ever written for money knows that this happens sometimes; it’s why we have kill fees.) But the reason was interesting: as it happens, my piece was not controversial <em>enough</em>. I didn’t poke fun at <em>xe</em> or <em>ey</em>, or any similarly sexy new grammatical constructions. I didn’t even spend that much time with <em>he </em>and <em>she</em>. Most of it was about the <em>other</em> pronouns, the uncontroversial ones, <em>I</em> and <em>me</em> and <em>you</em>, because I think they’re a lot more interesting than they seem. ‘You can get in a lot of trouble,’ I began, ‘if you call someone by the wrong pronoun. For instance, there are some people who must never be addressed as <em>you</em>.’</p><p>Every so often, some politician or media figure makes a grand declaration, usually totally unprompted. <em>I will never use pronouns. You will never catch me using a single pronoun</em>. And then everyone clambers over each other trying to point out that actually, they’ve just used three. This ritual takes place every few months, and nobody seems to learn much from the experience, even though it sometimes makes it into the actual newspaper. We tend not to think too much about these words. We just say them: they fall out of our mouths so easily that you can end up puking out a bunch of pronouns without even noticing. </p><p>This is a pretty good clue that there’s something up: whenever you come across a part of existence that seems totally natural and obvious, you can be certain that some vast ideological structure is working behind the stage. And it is. Pronouns might be the most intrinsically <em>political</em> words in the English language; this is how we describe who we are and how we relate to other people. It’s not for nothing that in the 2016 US Democratic primary, the choice could basically be expressed as a conflict between two different sets of pronouns. <em>I’m with her. Not me, us</em>.</p><p>So in my piece I wrote a little about the contemporary squabbles over gendered pronouns, but a lot more about other things—like, for instance, the fact that Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, once forbade any of his subjects from uttering the word <em>zhèn </em>(朕), or <em>I</em>. Everyone else had to start using the much plainer <em>wo</em> (我) instead, which is still the ordinary first-person pronoun in modern Chinese. (There’s an apocryphal account in which <em>wo</em> originally meant something like <em>this worthless body</em>.) This seems extreme, but I think I get it. Why should some ordinary peasant get to have the same grandeur of self as the Son of Heaven? There’s something imperious<em> </em>about <em>I</em>, even in English—<em>especially</em> in English: that grand stark majuscule, thrusting itself into the world. (No other language capitalises its first-person pronoun; in German my toenails take the grand <em>Zehennagel</em>, but I am merely <em>ich</em>. Why do we do it? Well, a lowercase <em>i</em> is very small, and it could get lost: fourteenth-century monks were worried that future transcriptors might accidentally lump it together with the start or end of the surrounding words. The self is like a lonely comet, falling into any nearby gravity sink—so they made it into a sun. Maybe this is another reason why, four hundred years down the line, industrial capitalism emerged in England rather than somewhere else.) Other people have felt it too. Theodor Adorno’s <em>Minima Moralia</em> contains a horribly sharpened little aphorism. ‘Among some people,’ he writes, ‘it is already an impertinence to say <em>I</em>.’  That line might not land in quite the same way if he’d said the impertinent syllable was <em>me</em>.</p><p>Pronouns have strange histories and stranger uses; they’re the material residue of thousands of years of class struggle. They reveal some of the hidden rules that govern our lives. But in the end, my editor suggested that I could narrow my focus a little, and write about gender dysphoria instead.</p><p>There are a lot of essays about gender dysphoria out there; most of them seem to be on this platform, and not all of them are bad. But if you’re interested in the other stuff, this one is for you. </p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><div><hr></div><p>I’ll start with <em>you</em>, since you’re already here.</p><p>Imagine a decaying old English aristocrat, stuck in a decaying old country pile. It’s a dark, cold, heavy morning: the formal gardens are flooded, and rain hammers down on a leaky, clattering roof. Most of the rooms are boarded up; the furniture’s been sold or covered in plastic sheeting, the staff whittled down to one crusting butler. But how does this butler talk? There’s one very ordinary word that’s strangely missing. <em>Would his lordship like marmalade with his toast this morning? Would sir like me to turn on the TV? </em>Even while you fuss around this person, you have to talk about him in the third person, as if he isn’t actually there. </p><p>It’s still considered rude for anyone to say <em>you</em> to the reigning British monarch: you call him <em>Your Majesty</em> first, and subsequently <em>sir</em>, and never by the second-person pronoun or his name. The rule isn’t much enforced now—Paddington Bear broke it several times during his brief, awkward encounter with the Queen—but it <em>is</em> upheld in our supposedly democratic institutions. Parliamentarians are a notoriously fractious lot, but they still balk at calling each other the y-word. Never <em>you’re clearly some kind of cretin</em>, but <em>the honourable member for Birmingham Yardley is clearly some kind of cretin</em>. Technically, the only person who can be called <em>you</em> in the House of Commons is the Speaker, who will eventually eject you from the chamber if you try to apostrophise anyone else. But even then, as a mark of respect, the Speaker is rarely actually called <em>you</em>, but <em>sir </em>or <em>ma’am</em> instead.</p><p>Yes, this is just one clammy little island off the coast of Europe. But while America is supposed to have more of a democratic spirit, you still run into the <em>you</em>-taboo whenever you encounter systems of formal power. American cops, for instance, simply do not like to be addressed in the second person. I learned this the hard way: I lived in California for a year, when I was reckless and 21 years old and not massively bothered by their funny colonial laws on sharing a few drinks under the open sky. If you talk to a cop in America the way you’d talk to any other person—the way I’m talking to you now—his eyes will narrow and his jaw will set hard and he’ll immediately decide that you are nebulously failing to respect his authority. He will find a way to make your life difficult. Eventually, you might end up in a courtroom—and in a courtroom, the judge is to be referred to as <em>your honour</em> or, metonymically, <em>the court</em>, but never, never <em>you</em>.</p><p>What’s so unpleasant about <em>you</em>? I find myself writing in the second person quite a lot: you might have noticed me doing it a few times already in this essay; you might notice me doing it right now. If my prose is getting too fiddly or overwrought, I find that sticking a <em>you</em> in there helps take things down a little. (Your experience may differ.) This word can be very egalitarian. It carries a kind of cheerful indifference; the same pronoun works for absolutely everyone except yourself, applying equally to an all-conquering world-emperor or the little inbred dog in his lap. <em>Aren’t you a good boy? Aren’t you a good tyrant?</em> Which is fatal to a certain kind of social distinction: hence the need for all those embellishments for very special individuals. <em>Your majesty</em>, <em>your honour</em>, or even <em>sir</em>. </p><p>At the same time, <em>you</em> can be individuating, even intimate. In the <em>Odyssey</em>, the third-person narration sometimes breaks down, but only around one particular character. <em>Τὸν δ’ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εὔμαιε συβῶτα</em>… ‘As a reply to him, you, the swineherd Eumaeus, said…’ Patroclus, the friend and lover of Achilles, gets the same treatment in the <em>Iliad</em>. Epic apostrophe sounds strange to us today, especially since generations of creative writing students have been repeatedly instructed to never write fiction in the second person. Still, it’s clearly a mark of affection: the poet is lifting Eumaeus out of the broad cast of the story, speaking directly to him, drawing a veil of privacy around his words. But Eumaeus is also a swineherd: a servant. The <em>most loyal</em> servant, the most honoured swineherd, but always a subordinate. Homer might not have been so comfortable chucking his <em>you</em> at godlike Odysseus.</p><p>Being individuated, then, is not always <em>nice</em>. Althusser describes the most basic scene of ideology in action: you’re walking down the street, and suddenly hear a policeman behind you, shouting: ‘Hey, you there!’ The street might be crowded, but you’re the one who turns around; immediately, you recognise that this <em>you there</em> refers, specifically, to <em>you</em>. A kind of iron cage has closed around you, even before you’re led away in handcuffs. You have been marked, torn away from the crowd, turned into an <em>object</em> by forces more powerful than you are. A word that can be tender and secret, a whisper—in the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon. At its most granular level, politics is a pronoun.</p><div><hr></div><p>Althusser’s policeman doesn’t actually say <em>hey, you there</em>. He says ‘<em>hé, vous, là-bas!</em>’ French has two forms of the word <em>you</em>: the formal, respectful plural <em>vous</em> and the informal, intimate singular <em>tu</em>. A surprising number of languages follow this pattern: not just those based on Latin, but also Finnish and Somali and Hindi and Chinese. Not a random grammatical quirk, but a near-universal horror of looking a stranger in the eyes and calling them <em>you</em>. The <em>vous</em> form seems to take some of the edge off the second person; you talk to someone as if you were addressing a multitude. When said by a stranger, it feels less like a pair of eyes drilling into your skull. But not all French police always said <em>vous</em>: in France’s overseas empire, the colonial police would address locals as <em>tu</em>—something like a Jim Crow-era cop calling a black man <em>boy</em>. You can imagine what might happen if someone dared to say <em>tu</em> back.</p><p>Other languages chop up the second person pronoun even finer. Portuguese has the informal singular <em>tu</em> and the formal plural <em>vós</em>, but there’s also the hyperformal <em>você</em>, a contraction of <em>vossa mercê</em>—literally, <em>your mercy</em>. In Portugal, calling someone <em>você</em> can be deeply offensive: it sounds cold; it reeks of rank. <em>Você na minha terra é um burro</em>. <em>In my country, </em>você<em> is a donkey.</em> Among Brazilians, it’s completely normal. In the colonies, cruelty rules.</p><p>Standard English is different: we only use the one word. This means that there’s no gender-neutral way to refer to a mixed group of people, if you happen to think (as some do) that <em>you guys</em> is unacceptably masculine. Sometimes people try to solve this problem by poaching a word from a more grammatically complex dialect, which is why socially-conscious white Americans who’ve never set foot in the South have started constantly saying <em>y’all</em>. (The practice has even spread to well-educated young Londoners, who apparently prefer this prestige American import to the perfectly serviceable <em>youse</em> only a short train ride away in Liverpool.) But in fact, English already has a formal second-person plural pronoun. It’s <em>you</em>.</p><p>All you need to do is look at the words: <em>you</em> is a cognate of <em>vous</em>; our version of <em>tu</em> is <em>thou</em>. Strangely, most people tend to assume that things are the other way round—that <em>thou</em> must be the more formal version, since it’s old-fashioned, and we imagine that the past was much starchier than our nice liberal present. No: <em>we’re</em> the prissy ones. Today, even when we say <em>I love you</em>, we’re holding the other person at a remove. An observer from the past would think that all our human relations carry the same distant, respectful tone as a business letter or an encounter with the police.</p><p>There is a history here. At some point in the seventeenth century, the rising capitalist classes developed a prim horror of any and all use of <em>thou</em>. On the one hand, it was too bawdy, too intimate; it marked you out as one of the unwashed classes, the people who didn’t know how to be polite. At the same time, it could be condescending, superior, even a kind of slur. (During Walter Raleigh’s 1603 treason trial, the prosecutor refused to use Raleigh’s preferred pronoun: ‘I <em>thou</em> thee, thou traitor!’) Obviously, stamping out the word didn’t work; <em>you</em> has inherited everything that once made <em>thou</em> so unbearable. But in fact, the bourgeois revolution is still incomplete. Quakers continued to insist on <em>thou</em> into the twentieth century; saying <em>you</em> was—like doffing your hat—a kind of blasphemy, since God created us equal. In <em>Moby-Dick</em>, Melville describes the Nantuckers ‘in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom,’ but the point was to be <em>less</em> stately and dramatic than the fancy city folk with their highfalutin <em>you</em>. And in the north of England, and especially Yorkshire and Lancashire, people still refer to each other as <em>tha</em> or <em>thee</em>. These places were also, throughout the twentieth century, bulwarks of British socialism. This might not be a coincidence.</p><div><hr></div><p>I’ve been talking a lot about <em>etiquette</em>, which ways of using language are rude and which are polite—but etiquette is just a highly formalised way of expressing class.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> You could distinguish three broad forms. In <em>aristocratic</em> manners, pronouns distinguish between different <em>types</em> of people. Like everything associated with the aristocracy, this etiquette is luxuriantly artificial. It survived the rise of capitalism, but barely, holding out in arenas of spectacularised power. Courtrooms and colonies, yes, but also cafés. Not so long ago, a waiter in a Paris restaurant would call his customers <em>vous</em>; they would call him <em>tu</em>. For a while, the service sector still carried a quiet echo of its feudal origins. Not any more. </p><p><em>Bourgeois</em> manners, the etiquette of the ‘decoding and decoded class,’ are universalising. Not a knowing convention, but a kind of verbal hygiene, as natural and inevitable as the laws of physics. Where the aristocracy wrote books of etiquette only for themselves, and sometimes enforced sumptuary laws to prevent the third estate copying their manners, the bourgeoisie expect everyone to use the same language and conform to a single standard of <em>correct</em> behaviour. Actual inequality is papered over with a certain abstract blankness: waiter and customer both say <em>vous</em>. Both have to pretend that they aren’t, however briefly, acting out the roles of liege and fief. Domination is not ritualised, but effaced. After all, we’re both just free individuals in the marketplace. </p><p>For obvious reasons, <em>proletarian</em> etiquette has rarely been enforced on society as a whole, but there have been attempts. At the height of the French Revolution, the Committee for Public Safety ordered all citizens to drop the <em>vous</em> form entirely and embrace universal <em>tutoyer</em>. In early twentieth-century Sweden, the system of formal address had become so complex that most people, even friends, were resorting to tortured grammatical constructions that avoided the need for any pronouns at all. (Another option was to substitute surnames or job titles. This system persisted for a while after Sweden’s sexual revolution, which means you can imagine someone saying, in the heat of the moment, to someone they didn’t know particularly well, <em>does Ms Lindqvist want me to put it in Ms Lindqvist’s arse?</em>) Then, in 1967, at the peak of the country’s social-democratic era, the system broke down and everyone adopted the informal <em>du</em>. (The exception, obviously, was the Swedish royal family, who were still addressed in the third person.) But since the turn to neoliberalism in the 1990s, things are changing again: in shops and offices, <em>ni</em>, the formal <em>vous</em>-form, has been creeping back in.</p><p>Sometimes, familiarity gets in through stranger cracks in the world. In English, we use formal language with our friends, but not with God. ‘Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.’</p><div><hr></div><p>Pronouns are <em>weird</em>.</p><p>These words are iridescent: they change colour depending on the angle of the light. The linguistic term for this is <em>deixis</em>. Most of our language stays static—‘rose is a rose is a rose is a rose’—but deictic terms do not. <em>Tomorrow</em> refers to an entirely different day every 24 hours, and <em>there </em>is only a short walk from <em>here</em>. Similarly, the same person can be <em>me</em> or <em>you</em> or <em>him</em>, depending on who’s speaking. Pronouns are also the only words in English that still have a system of declension: the words change depending on whether they’re active or passive in a sentence. <em>He/him</em>, <em>she/her</em>. Not just a minor grammatical difference. The 1965 film <em>She</em> is about an immortal queen, cruel and terrifying, who has ruled her desert kingdom for two thousand years. The 2013 film <em>Her</em> is about a lonely man who falls in love with the female voice of an AI assistant on his phone.</p><p>Maybe the starkest distinction is in the first person. We think of ourselves as singular, but most of us have two entirely separate names for ourselves. Sometimes you are an <em>I</em>: the first-person subjective, the thing that you experience as yourself, the buzz and rush that lives in the dark space behind your eyes. But sometimes you are a <em>me</em>: the first-person objective, the creature in the mirror, the version of yourself that’s seen by other people. An object.</p><p>As Qin Shi Huang knew,<em> I</em> can be arrogant, self-obsessed. Newspaper columnists are advised not to start their first sentence with <em>I</em>: it gives the impression that the whole thing will just be you droning on about your own bullshit. Politicians are warned not to drop too many <em>I</em>s in a speech: it makes voters think you’re just in it for yourself. Two classes of people who probably need the advice. <em>Me</em> is softer, more agreeable. When you say <em>me</em>, you’re describing yourself from the outside, as a <em>thing</em> that can be seen and known. Sentences with <em>me</em> need something else to fill the subject-position; they tend to draw in the other people who share your world. <em>See me. Touch me. What do you want with me? </em>This word blooms with a constant mild eroticism—but it has its dangers too. You could think of narcissism as an excess of <em>me</em>, an image of yourself that ends up blotting out your actual inner life. Think about the people who endlessly show off on social media. <em>Look at me! Look at my car, and my clothes, and my perfect life! </em>And meanwhile the <em>I</em>, this small, sad, suffering creature, withers away unknown.</p><p>Sometimes, <em>I </em>and <em>me</em> can mark out entirely different ways of navigating the world. In Jamaica, the first-person pronoun is always <em>me</em>, without declension. So Capleton: ‘Dem no like me and me no like dem.’ Most everyday communication in Jamaica is in a creole: a regularised, outward-facing language formed in the contact zones between two different linguistic communities.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> Its uniform <em>me</em> is gregarious and prosocial—but on the same island, devout Rastafarians do precisely the opposite: they only use <em>I</em>. Bob Marley: ‘Old pirates, yes they rob I, sold I to the merchant ships…’ This is a very deliberate choice. The point is to emphasise the speaker as a free, thinking individual—never an object, not something for anyone else to buy or sell or use. Some Rastafarians will swap out <em>all</em> of the personal pronouns. <em>He </em>and <em>she </em>become <em>I</em>, <em>we</em> becomes <em>I and I</em>, <em>what do you want from me</em> becomes <em>what does I want from I</em>. A very different take on the you-taboo: instead of lifting certain special individuals out of ordinary language, my pronouns can recognise that everyone I meet is also a subject, also a secret storm of life, exactly the same as I.</p><div><hr></div><p>None of this is what people usually mean when they talk about the politics of pronouns. </p><p>Take just one example. In 2020, the <em>London Review of Books</em> published an essay by the philosopher Amia Srinivasan on the politics of pronouns. It’s a good essay. The piece focuses on the quest to find a workable gender-neutral third-person pronoun, which is, as she points out, much older than we tend to think: English-language writers were coming up with ‘one new pronoun a year for nearly ninety years’ between 1841 and 1929. I find this stuff fascinating, in the same way that I find all dogged inventiveness fascinating. I like the Promethean spirit behind <em>thon</em> (1858) and <em>twon</em> (1884) and <em>id</em> (1887) and <em>ith</em> (1890) and <em>oo</em> (1929). I especially admire xenopronouns, which Srinivasan doesn’t get into: words that aren’t intended to be gender-neutral, exactly, but to conjure up entirely different languages of being. <em>Borea</em>, <em>mossirs</em>, <em>licoriceself</em>; pronouns that might echo the sounds of nature, humming machinery, or outer space. ‘Duskwatergender is a xenogender under the Bedtime System umbrella that relates to getting up in the middle of the night for a glass of water.’ ‘Sana is one of the base metals from the alloy alignment system based on tin. It represents a gender that is, to some degree, unknown, confusing, undefinable, or chaotic.’ Online, people have collaborated on master lists of new pronouns, thousands of lines long. This stuff tends to come in for a lot of mockery. I don’t see why: it’s beautiful. This baroque and intricate system, this strange new map of the world.</p><p>Here’s the thing, though. In an essay that’s over seven thousand words, devoted entirely to the question of <em>what pronouns people use for themselves</em>, Srinivasan never mentions that the answer is the same for almost everyone, whatever their gender: <em>I</em> or <em>me</em>. I don’t think this is a minor omission. If you want to get <em>out</em> of the sheer tedium of the pronoun wars, you have to start with the basic questions of what these words are and how they’re used, rather than treating them as a shorthand for squabbling about gender.</p><p>I’m not interested in writing about gender here, just grammar. If that annoys you, if you want me to stop avoiding the real issue when there’s so much at stake, then frankly this is <em>your fault</em>, because somehow you’ve made sex more boring than syntax. But fine: let’s do it. Let’s talk about <em>he</em>, <em>she</em>, and <em>they</em>.</p><p>There’s a faction in the pronoun fracas that takes a very firm line: some people simply <em>are</em> a <em>he</em>, and others simply <em>are</em> a <em>she</em>, and nothing those people say or do will ever change that fact. You were born with your pronouns attached, like a wet placenta of words. One widely-shared internet article compares preferred pronouns to Rohypnol. ‘They change our perception, lower our defences, make us react differently, alter the reality in front of us… Forcing our brains to ignore the evidence of our eyes, to ignore a conflict between what we see and know to be true, and what we are expected to say.’ In other words: there’s one set of pronouns that belongs to reality, and another that belongs to something else, and that <em>something else</em> is trying to do you harm.</p><p>I’m not sure this is true. If you want, you can find YouTube compilations of people who <em>refuse</em> to use preferred pronouns still doing so accidentally—defaulting to <em>she</em> for trans women and <em>he</em> for trans men. In Boccaccio’s fourteenth-century <em>Decameron</em>, pronouns switch around when someone merely <em>disguises</em> themselves as the opposite sex. Whatever these words refer to, it’s not our chromosomes.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a>  </p><p>But more broadly, <em>every</em> pronoun is, in its own way, unnatural. It’s not a given that I am really <em>I</em>, or that you can safely be called <em>you</em>. (<em>He</em> and <em>she</em> are no exception. Weird things happen in languages with gendered noun classes: in French, a king is technically referred to as <em>her majesty</em>, since <em>majesté</em> is feminine. Pronouns would reflect the title; for centuries various war-battered monarchs went around being called <em>elle</em>.) These words are shaped by centuries of ethical claims and political conflict. Most of the time, that conflict is buried so deep you don’t notice it. If preferred pronouns are Rohypnol, then all language is a drug; you’ve been roofied since the day you first learned to speak.</p><p>But there’s a <em>but</em>. The other side will also, occasionally, do the exact same thing: they act as if a pronoun is simply a <em>fact about yourself</em>.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a></p><p>Let’s think about the biological females who hate being referred to as <em>she</em>, and the biological males who get similarly upset by <em>he</em>. There are a lot more of these people than you might think. Use these pronouns in their presence and you’ll get a cold stare, a sharp rebuke, even physical violence. For instance: my parents. Call my mum <em>she</em> to her face, and she’ll snap: <em>Who is </em>she<em>? The cat’s mother?</em> Call my dad<em> he</em>, and he’ll grumble: <em>Hello?</em> He <em>can hear you, you know</em>… Neither of my parents, I should mention, are trans or non-binary; they’re not objecting to being identified as a man or a woman. Something much subtler is going on. Calling a trans woman <em>she</em> is, in most cases, absolutely not <em>common fucking courtesy</em>. It’s deeply, deeply rude.</p><p>What kind of rudeness is this? Why do we not like being spoken to in the third person? Kings and aristocrats don’t mind, and neither do judges or British parliamentarians; in fact, they’ll insist on it. (Until 1967, ordinary Swedes <em>pretended</em> they didn’t mind, but they were very glad to start saying <em>you</em> instead.) What these people have in common is an elaborate social structure that establishes their personal importance. Nobody can be in any doubt that a judge is a significant presence in a courtroom. But under the bourgeois system, third-person pronouns are not used when you’re talking <em>to</em> someone. They’re for when you’re talking <em>about</em> someone—usually, when that person isn’t there. Using these pronouns in someone’s presence often means you don’t really care whether they’re in the room with you or not. The direct message it encodes is extremely cruel. <em>You don’t matter. Leave if you want. Don’t bother saying goodbye.</em> We’re in a paradox: to respectfully use someone’s preferred pronouns, it’s imperative that they never actually hear you doing so.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a></p><p>This is why there’s always some awkwardness around how to actually signal these words. <em>I use he/him pronouns</em>. No you don’t; you use <em>I/me</em>, like everyone else. <em>My pronouns are she/her</em>. Are you sure? Derrida once pointed out that your own name is always external to you, since it’s the sign that everyone uses <em>except</em> yourself. There can be no name for what you are; even an <em>I</em> doesn’t mark out what makes you unique, since everyone else calls themselves the exact same thing. Your inner being exists, as Srinivasan puts it, ‘beyond the reach of mere words… exceeding, bursting beyond.’ So is any pronoun ever really <em>yours</em>?</p><p>This, I think, is why there’s so much <em>bitterness</em> in the pronoun wars, and why the pronoun has such a totemic status in the wider gender shitshow. For a certain bourgeois etiquette, the request for a particular pronoun sounds like a declaration of right over the intersubjective commons, something uncomfortably aristocratic. <em>This is how you must think of me; this is how you must talk about me, even when I’m not around. </em>The demand that you should get to determine <em>who you are</em> in the eyes of the other.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" target="_self">6</a> Like a lord inventing new titles for himself.</p><p>I do not think this is really what’s going on. Instead, what we’re witnessing is a minor tragedy of language. It just so happens that the only gendered pronouns in English are the ones we use to talk about <em>other people</em>. But none of this is inevitable, and none of it is fixed. There are plenty of languages in which these pronouns are entirely ungendered, but some in which they change if a person is older or younger, or near or far away. Múra-Pirahã, which is admittedly weird, assigns objects different pronouns depending on whether or not they are underwater. In 1985, Douglas Hofstadter made the argument for gender-neutral language by imagining a world in which all our grammar is, horrifyingly, arranged around <em>race</em>. ‘Another of Niss Moses’ shrill objections is to the age-old differentiation of whites from blacks by the third-person pronouns “whe” and “ble.” Ble promotes an absurd notion: that what we really need in English is a single pronoun covering both races. Numerous suggestions have been made, such as “pe,” “tey,” and others. These are all repugnant to the nature of the English language, as the average white in the street will testify.’ Thai has gendered first-person pronouns; so does Hebrew. How different might our politics be if we didn’t have a gendered <em>he</em> or <em>she</em>, or <em>you</em>, or even <em>me</em>, but if we had to make some statement about how we relate to the world, one that grammar forbade anyone else from disputing, every time we said <em>I</em>?</p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>This might be why deliberate rudeness can raise the spectre of social revolution, and why it’s not a very encouraging sign that so much of the contemporary left seems to be mostly concerned with enforcing various standards of politesse. Conspicuous adherence to etiquette is deeply obnoxious; I think I’d rather be tortured to death than become one of those people who won’t shut up about how they always thank the bus driver. Yes, it’s nice to thank the bus driver—but when that becomes your entire politics, all you’ll ever do is annoy people. Fuck you, pal! Don’t tell me what to do! Still, it might be better to be a liberal prig than the opposite: the person who ostentatiously <em>refuses</em> to observe good manners, who bravely wipes their hands on someone else’s napkin and spits in the soup—and then starts freaking out about this <em>new tyranny</em> when they’re not invited back for dinner.</p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-2" href="#footnote-anchor-2" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">2</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>As it happens, standard English is also an island creole, a dramatically simplified version of Anglo-Saxon once spoken by the invading Danes.

Not because the singular <em>they</em> is awkward or ungrammatical, which it isn’t. We all use it all the time; I’ve already used it once in this footnote, and you hardly noticed. But we tend to use it in very particular situations: it’s a word for shadows, generalities, and ghosts. <em>An ordinary person might discover they have hidden strengths…</em> Which person? Where? There’s no answer. <em>I saw someone in the fog; they were speaking, but I couldn’t make out their words…</em> <em>They</em> increases with distance; it’s an index of unfamiliarity. You were probably described as <em>they</em> at some point today, but it was by someone you don’t know, and whose words you’ll never hear. <em>Someone let their dog shit right outside the door.</em> Anonymous traces; a person without a face.

This is a very obvious way of doing things and it tends to get us nowhere. A properly <em>critical</em> approach, though, wouldn’t just examine the points of dissensus; it would try to understand the <em>terrain</em> of conflict as well, the unspoken assumptions that ground the debate, the points on which both sides secretly agree. </p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-5" href="#footnote-anchor-5" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">5</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Maybe it’s significant that most of the pronoun wars tend to take place online—where there’s <em>nobody</em> actually in the room, but we’ve all got our ears pressed to the windows, listening in. </p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-6" href="#footnote-anchor-6" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">6</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Of course, <em>everyone</em> very badly wants the power to decide what other people think of them; in the end, it’s the <em>only</em> thing we want. There is a version of yourself that lives in the minds of other people, and the vast majority of all human effort is geared towards trying to control that little person and make it more like the version of yourself that lives in your <em>own</em> head. In the aristocratic system, you could simply issue it orders. Huizinga describes how European nobles of the fourteenth century, often too comfortable for any actual heroic feats of chivalry, started building their reputations on extravagant chivalric vows and boasts instead. But in any bourgeois etiquette, simply telling the little person what to do is forbidden: you have to play a cautious game with coded, deniable signals. Oversignalling is swiftly punished. The fastest way to make sure nobody will ever respect you is to walk around demanding respect. If you want to instantly turn someone off, start desperately keening about how badly you need them to love you. The people who join Mensa are, as everyone knows, insecure and probably a bit thick. Years ago, I found myself sitting across a train from a man listening to music through his headphones and extravagantly lip-synching along. Squirming around in his seat, doing little dances. I know exactly what he was thinking: <em>everyone on this train must be so impressed by me and how much I’m enjoying this wonderful music</em>. We all thought he was a twat.</p></div></div>

The unnameable object of desire (???, 200,000 BC)</pre></div><div><hr></div><p>Not long ago, I woke up suddenly in the middle of the night with a startling and beautiful insight shimmering on the surface of my mind. It was brilliant and it was true and I could already feel it fading, going dull on contact with the waking world like cut magnesium. I had to write it down. I knew that we all wake up multiple times every night and don’t remember any of it in the morning. I was a sort of brief parallel version of myself, outside the normal stream of being, and possessing special knowledge. Very soon, I would vanish into a forgetfulness not unlike death. But before that happened, I had to tell my other self what I knew. I sat up in bed and frantically scribbled an outline of my beautiful insight, trying to capture as many of its finer details as I could before they melted away. Then, once it was done, I turned over and collapsed into a deep, deep, dreamless sleep. </p><p>I’m not sure I managed to capture <em>everything</em>. But the main idea survived. On waking, I found a note. It consisted of a single word:</p><p><em>NAPOPPENHEIMELEONER</em></p><p>I think I remember some of the concept. A script for the greatest blockbuster in history, in which we see Napoppenheimeleoner, terrible amalgam of two great warriors, winning battle after battle and then wandering the fields of mangled corpses in nebbishy regret, doing his Maintenant-je-suis-devenu-la-Mort routine as ranks of Russian cavalry in gleaming uniforms vanish into the growing ball of nuclear fire. At the time, I’ll admit, I had not actually seen either film. But I did watch Christopher Nolan’s <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYPbbksJxIg">Oppenheimer</a> </em>shortly afterwards, with the idea that maybe if there was anything interesting there I could obey the mysterious demands of my shadow-self and write something fun about the monstrous Napoppenheimeleoner. But there was nothing interesting there. <em>Oppenheimer</em> is bafflingly, pointlessly soulless and shit. Less an actual film than a three-hour-long trailer: just snapshots, stitched together, each scene lasting a few minutes at most, until you start to get something like motion sickness. Here’s J Robert in a classroom. Now he’s riding horses in the desert. Now he’s having sex with a woman; now she’s dead. There’s no space for anything to <em>breathe</em>. On to the next scene. At no point in this mad rush is there any attempt to portray any of the actual sensuous <em>texture</em> of life, which is one thing cinema can be quite good at. What are Oppenheimer’s living quarters at Los Alamos like? What does he do when he wakes up in the morning? What did building the atom bomb actually involve, and what did it <em>feel like</em> to be knowingly working so hard to kill so many people? We literally never find out. We just cut from one tedious administrative meeting to another. You get the sense that Nolan isn’t really <em>interested</em> in much. Not nuclear physics, not the terrible responsibilities of the atomic age, or the romance of Communism, or the cruel machinery of the US government; in fact, he doesn’t even seem to care at all about J Robert Oppenheimer, as a man or a totem. What he cares about are the following: firstly, shoving as many scientists and politicians in front of our faces as possible, so we all appreciate how thoroughly he’s done his homework, and secondly, employing a <em>Mirror</em>-wannabe non-linear storytelling technique for no apparent reason whatsoever. It sucks.</p><p>But I wasn’t really surprised that <em>Oppenheimer</em> is not very good. This is Christopher Nolan, the man who once set an entire film <em>inside a dream</em> but couldn’t think of anything better for his characters to do in there than shoot guns at each other. I wasn’t even surprised that film critics—people whose only job it is to tell the difference between a good film and a bad one—unanimously loved this thing. I have occasionally done some very ordinary magazine film reviews myself, so I’m not excepting myself when I say that film critics are all a bunch of plankton-eating mental bivalves whose entire critical intelligence consists in wrenching open their calcified flaps to filter any specks of mediocrity floating around in the abysses of our culture, and the only thing they’re really good for is being boiled alive in a big pot with some shallots and parsley. Of course they thought <em>Oppenheimer</em> was a towering achievement; of course it’s about to win a bathtub full of awards. These people are towered over by <em>seaweed</em>. What <em>did</em> surprise me, though, was the response to Ridley Scott’s <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAZWXUkrjPc">Napoleon</a></em>. Suddenly, these same creatures could quite easily identify a film that tried to do too much and ended up hardly doing anything at all, even with an absurdly bloated runtime. So <em>now</em> you can spot limp unspectacular acting, can you? Now you know when a big statement movie doesn’t actually have any propositional content? Now you can tell when a once-vaunted British director is clearly over the hill?</p><p>What the critics didn’t spot, though, is that <em>Napoleon</em> isn’t really about the historical Napoleon Bonaparte at all: it’s about the secret mechanism of the human soul. Earlier this year, I wrote a big rambling screed against <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-repulsive-crust">therapeutic realism</a>, practically begging for some mainstream pop culture that does something, anything else: art that doesn’t always treat its human material as tediously <em>explicable</em>, that doesn’t feel the need to render everything in the dull flat language of pop-psychological literalism, but is willing to recognise the dark void of the senseless that distinguishes a free human being from an automaton in flesh, and which must be represented in symbols rather than signs. And finally, mainstream culture is doing precisely that. This is important! Every year, mainstream culture loses a little more ground, and some people might celebrate: after all, mainstream culture is failing because it has, for the last decade-plus, mostly been a culture of lazy, joyless sequels and bizarre moral didacticism. But look at what’s replacing it. Two-second clips of people falling over. ChatGPT fed into text-to-speech. The closest thing to an extended, coherent narrative is about singing heads that emerge out of toilets. People will sit for hours and watch a live stream of a woman describing emojis and sometimes pretending to eat them. <em>Mmm ice cream so good</em>! Whatever this is, a functioning shared mainstream culture in which people are actually trying to <em>make something worthwhile</em> seems vastly preferable. So it’s very good news that Hollywood is once again trying to speak to the human condition. But because you are addicted to your own chains, you hate it. You hated <em>Napoleon</em>. You hated <em>Wish</em>.</p><p>Look: I understand why people would not want to like <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyRxxpD3yNw">Wish</a></em>. This media product is a big smug self-referential tribute act with which the Walt Disney Company is commemorating its hundredth anniversary, and who has any warm feelings for Disney? Who wants to nonconsensually attend someone else’s birthday party? It doesn’t help that the film garbles bits of plot and style from <em>Pinocchio </em>and <em>Snow White</em> and <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> in what was clearly supposed to be a nostalgic tribute, but feels more like a rummage around in a mass grave. It doesn’t help that our main character is the same main character—brave and determined, with a strong sense of justice, and willing to risk everything to help her friends, but also for some reason physically clumsy to the point where you wonder if she ought to be wearing some kind of padded helmet—that seems to have been injected into every single mass-culture commodity on the planet, including those that are notionally for adults. It doesn’t help that the jokes aren’t funny. Or that every scene has the cheap glowing aura of an AI-generated image. Or that the songs have lyrics like this:</p><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text"><em>So I look up at the stars to guide me
And throw caution to every warning sign
If knowing what it could be is what drives me
Then let me be the first to stand in line</em></pre></div><p>People have tried to tell me that this verse does actually make sense. I’ll go into fits about how the songwriters behind these lines—whose names, incidentally, are Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice—have each produced a slew of Top 40 hits and won various awards, which means that the people who generate our mass culture, the people who are paid a presumably eye-popping amount to write the songs that will be heard by millions upon millions of people, literally <em>don’t know how words work</em>. Not just uninspired—actually <em>illiterate</em>. This has to be some kind of civilisational low point. Surely we have nowhere left to sink after this. But apparently, I’m overreacting. Yes, ‘throw caution to every warning sign’ is a monstrous failed clone of an an ordinary English idiom; still, you <em>know what they mean</em>. And I have to grudgingly admit that yes, I do know what they mean. The next one is trickier. ‘If knowing what it could be is what guides me’—what is this <em>it</em>? Is it caution? Is it the warning sign? Is it the same dummy <em>it</em> you find in phrases like <em>it’s raining</em>? And what is the <em>what</em> that the <em>it</em> could be? These are just <em>words</em>, packed in here like styrofoam to fill the space… I’m told that this also makes a kind of sense. <em>It</em> is the future; this person is driven by their hope for a better future. (In which case, wouldn’t it make far more sense to have ‘<em>how</em> it could be’ instead?) But I absolutely refuse to budge on the last one. ‘Let me be the first to stand in line.’ <em>What line</em>? First to stand in line <em>for what</em>? To change things for the better, apparently. Is there a line for that? Is there a place to queue up? Some bureau of changing things for the better? What on earth are you talking about? And besides—if you’re the <em>first</em> to stand in line, then <em>there is no line</em>. There’s just you! Standing!</p><p>So like I said, I understand why you wouldn’t like <em>Wish</em>. All I’ll say is this: if you didn’t like <em>Wish</em>, but you <em>did</em> like Andrei Tarkovsky’s beloved late-Soviet depressive masterpiece <em>Stalker</em>, then you are wrong, because these two films are, in fact, exactly the same film.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><div><hr></div><p>Let’s start with <em>Napoleon</em>. Here’s poor miscast Joaquin Phoenix (the actual Napoleon was basically a twink, a Timothée Chalamet role: they should have swapped; Phoenix might have done something interesting with Willy Wonka), mumbling around a too-dark screen. He doesn’t do much in the role, but he has a very difficult job: playing Napoleon means following every possibly mythical lunatic in every asylum who ever stuck his hand in his coat and bellowed <em>I’m Napoleon</em>! It’s worth asking: what are those possibly mythical lunatics actually claiming when they claim to be Napoleon? I don’t think they’re saying that they’re Corsican, born in 1769, that they trained as an artillery officer, or wrote pamphlets supporting the Jacobins during the Reign of Terror. Being Napoleon has little to do with the biography of a particular man who was once called Nabulio di Buonaparte. The lunatics are claiming to be the one glimpsed by Hegel after the Battle of Jena, the world-spirit on horseback. The great man in the great man theory of history. The one who boasted to Metternich that he spent thirty thousand lives a month—which would have made him something other than merely alive: a population-level event, universal history made flesh. The other person that madmen sometimes claim to be is Jesus Christ. Schizos think everything that happens is important (<em>what are my enemies trying to tell me by making it rain?</em>); what both names mean, Jesus and Napoleon, is that this person is not an ordinary person. Their human individuality is so significant that all actually human and individual dimensions are burned away: they have become an intense primordial force that could settle on anyone, in the same way that the god once possessed its worshippers. In the schizo world, which does occasionally bleed into our own, Napoleon is the true name of God. </p><p>This is not the Napoleon that Ridley Scott shows us. In fact, <em>Napoleon</em> is bereft of anything that even resembles politics. The entire French Revolution is dispatched in two scenes: one showing the beheading of Marie Antoinette, and one heavily abridging the events of 9 and 10 Thermidor. Instead of the actual febrile revolutionary politics of the street, we get the impression that the whole affair was mostly played out in gilded rooms. The only time we see a politicised mass of people, it’s the royalist mob in the battle of 13 Vendémiaire, whose only role is to stand aroud for a moment, shouting incoherently, before being turned into wisps of bloody vapour by Napoleon’s cannons. When he finally takes on the regalia of an emperor, even that disappears: the Revolution is over, and Napoleon is another crowned head among the crowned heads of Europe; he just happens to be better at war. The thirty thousand lives comment doesn’t appear, because it would force us to consider <em>why</em> the emperor of France can take hundreds of thousands of his subjects, put guns in their hands, and tell them to die for their country, while the emperor of Austria is very nervous about doing the same. There’s no Napoleonic Code. There’s no emancipation of the Jews. No metric system. No centralised rational state. No terrible wind of progress come to tear Europe out of its backwardness at the cost of millions dead. What there is, is Josephine. </p><p>People are not happy about this. They wanted some heroic abstraction; failing that, they wanted an exercise in Nolan-style pedantry. At the very least, a big satisfying Ridley Scott action movie. But Scott invents or discards aspects of Napoleon’s biography at will, and he doesn’t seem to care all that much about war. The Battle of Borodino—to which Tolstoy dedicates fourteen straight chapters of <em>War and Peace</em>, the unearthly roar of guns and muskets on each side, ‘increased to desperation like a man who, straining himself, shrieks with all his remaining strength,’ and which takes up more than half an hour of Sergei Bondarchuk’s gorgeous 1965 adaptation, re-enacted by some 30,000 Soviet soldiers—here, it takes all of about twelve seconds. The titanic Battle of Leipzig doesn’t appear at all. Instead of a great and tragic leader who could only be brought down by the combined arms of all of Europe, this Napoleon seems <em>pathetic</em>. A miserable cuckold, shy, more than mildly autistic, and pining after his Josephine like some imageboard creep. In this version, he returns from Egypt in 1799 because Josephine’s been fucking someone else. He escapes from Elba and plunges Europe into a hundred days of desperate, gruesome war because he wants to see Josephine. What makes a man decide to conquer the world? Why do some people turn themselves into gods and their brothers into corpses? What does the great man <em>want</em>? This film has an answer. He wants Josephine.</p><p>But Napoleon doesn’t stop conquering the world once he has Josephine. He doesn’t even stop <em>wanting</em> her. Napoleon wants his wife like a stalker wants his victim. He wants her in the full sense of a lack. Nothing is enough: he can fuck her, he can marry her, he can imprison her in his palace, but that gap still remains, which is why ten thousand Austrian soldiers have to bleed out on the ice. What he wants isn’t just to have Josephine, but to <em>be enough</em> for her, to totally satisfy her desire: in other words, to <em>extinguish</em> her desire. Only then will he be able to stop this desperate wanting. Josephine provides the form for all the armies he faces on the battlefield: his greatest, deadliest enemy, with whom he’s hopelessly in love. Lacan calls this obsessional neurosis, and obsessional neurosis is the closest thing we have to a normal, non-perverse, non-psychotic structure of desire. ‘‘Everything for the other person,’ the obsessive neurotic says, and that is indeed what he does, for being caught up in the perpetual whirlwind of destroying the other, he can never do enough to ensure that the other remains in existence.’ Maybe the clearest expression of this obsessional neurotic structure is in David Lynch’s <em>Lost Highway</em>. Bill Pullman can’t fuck his wife, he can’t extinguish Patricia Arquette’s desire; he plays angsty jazz instead. So the film shows us a solution: he can extinguish her desire by <em>killing her</em> and chopping her up into bits. But that doesn’t satisfy, so now the blockage is <em>literalised</em>; Patricia Arquette is back, but this time she’s going out with Bill Pullman’s missing phallus, in the form of a grotesque jealous gangster called Mr Eddy. ‘I love that girl to death. If I ever find out that somebody was making out with her, I’d take this and shove it so far up his ass…’ That works for a while, but eventually the problem has to be stated outright. He drives her out into the desert. They lie down together on the sands. As they fuck in the beam of the headlights, he whispers: ‘I want you.’ And she cradles his head, and says: ‘<em>You’ll never have me</em>.’</p><p>Ridley Scott’s <em>Napoleon</em> is, in every way that matters, exactly the same film. The thing that prevents Napoleon from satisfying Josephine is once again literalised: this time, it’s her inability to produce an heir to the throne of France. He can’t <em>fill her</em>. So the marriage has to be annulled, and immediately afterwards he sets out to force Tsar Alexander into the Continental System. The destruction of the Grande Armée is just an image of and a metaphor for his desperate struggle with Josephine, even if it just so happens that a similar army really was destroyed in Russia in the year 1812. What we’re watching is a <em>diagram of desire</em>, one that just so happens to use the life of a dead Corsican general for its coordinates, in the same way that Shakespeare used a Viking prince. And it’s a nice diagram, but obsessional neurosis is not really how desire tends to work any more. I <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/taylor-swift-does-not-exist">keep telling you people</a>: the problem isn’t that we don’t get what we want, it’s that we no longer even know <em>how to want</em>. We need another diagram. We need <em>Wish</em>.</p><div><hr></div><p>Critics have complained the basic setup in <em>Wish</em> is weird and convoluted and makes no sense. This is because the critics are philistines. <em>Wish</em> takes place on Rosas, an island in the Mediterranean ruled by a handsome and magical king called Magnifico, who came there fleeing some unspecified catastrophe on the mainland. Magnifico has the power to grant wishes. When the citizens of Rosas—who are cheerful, healthy, fond of breaking into song, and even fonder of their monarch—turn eighteen, they surrender their most sincerely-held wish to Magnifico, who keeps it safe for them until one of his monthly wish-granting ceremonies. Until then, you can live happily, free from the agony of unfulfilled desires. (Once it’s in Magnifico’s hands, every wish takes the form of a simple floating blue sphere, which is convenient for the animators.) Our brave, severely dyspraxic heroine is seventeen-year-old Asha, who’s applying to be the king’s apprentice when she spots her centenarian grandfather’s wish floating around in the vast ballpit of desire. He’d wished to create something to inspire the next generation. Would Magnifico consider granting his wish next? Absolutely not. It’s too dangerous. ‘Create what? A rebellious mob, perhaps? To inspire them to do what? To destroy Rosas, maybe?’ In fact, Magnifico reveals, almost everyone in Rosas will die without having their wish granted, and without ever knowing what their highest wish even <em>was</em>. That night, having finally seen through the bullshit of society, Asha tries wishing on a star, hoping for some fulfilment not governed by the mediation of Magnifico. And then, that star <em>falls out of the sky</em>.</p><p>So, who is this Magnifico? What does he represent? That one should be obvious. Who else do we know who’s self-obsessed, power-hungry, and was exiled after a terrible catastrophe to rule over a small island in the Mediterranean? </p><p>The broad critical consensus, though, is that Namagnifipoleocon represents the Walt Disney Company itself. They’ve unwittingly cast themselves as the villain, because they don’t even realise what they’ve become. The great tyrant atop his hoard of intellectual properties, self-appointed sovereign over our children’s dreams. Disney’s board of directors will tell you what you may hope for. You get your regular dose of mass-produced magic; in return, they get to privatise the human imagination. This was the basis of an entire generation of feminist critique: if little girls just want to be bland, passive, simpering princesses when they grow up, if they can only imagine themselves in relation to men, it’s because the Walt Disney Company has censored their desires. And this is also how we ended up with a generation of <em>Disney adults</em>, these terrifying jelly-eyed creatures, people in their thirties, forties, sagging, ageing, flabby monsters who keep talking about the childish values of <em>wonder</em> and <em>excitement</em> and <em>joy</em>, as if they’re the only people in the world to cherish those things, as if joy is only to be found in Disney products, because these people were <em>never weaned</em>, they never learned to find wonder and excitement and joy in the wide rich world itself, but had to be drip-fed all their enjoyment in increments of Disney-branded merchandise, utterly dead to everything good in life. They had a wish, once, and Magnifico took it away.</p><p>All this is true; you just have to dig into it a bit deeper. Which wishes does Magnifico specifically dislike? We see him grant the wish of a woman who wants to be the best dressmaker in Rosas, and a man who wants to be the most valiant and courageous knight. But not the one about inspiring the next generation. Why not? Magnifico likes it when you want to <em>be</em> someone; he doesn’t like wishes that have to do with relations <em>between</em> people. Meanwhile, the old feminist critique of the Disney princess has now been fully integrated into the company’s products. It’s a very long time since a Disney film has ended with some kind of happily-ever-after; the handsome prince is more likely to be revealed as a vain, cruel, pompous boor. If the House of Windsor-Mountbatten is anything to go by, this is broadly accurate. But what usually accompanies this revelation is the implicit message that you don’t need other people to be happy; all you really need is yourself. You don’t need esteem. You don’t need love. You don’t need a kiss to wake you out of your slumber. All you need is to <em>believe in yourself</em>; you are the only acceptable object of your desire. If you absolutely must exist in some kind of relation to other people, those people should be part of your nuclear family. (The stock Disney ending now usually involves the heroine reconciling with a sibling or parent.) Any other attachments are just obstacles to your project of entrepreneurial self-realisation. For reasons I genuinely can’t fathom, this shift was taken to be somehow <em>progressive</em>.</p><p>But it’s obviously not the case that the Walt Disney Company <em>invented</em> this kind of psychotic monadism; they were just carried along in the same vague social current that’s tugging us all towards the dissolution of all remaining social bonds. Asking what Magnifico represents is, in a way, the wrong question. He’s a Mr Eddy; your own psychic structure in the guise of an external villain. What he really means is this: that you don’t know what you want, you don’t even <em>recognise</em> the object of your desire, because you have not really been desiring anything. In <em>Napoleon</em>, you get what you want without getting it; in <em>Wish</em>, you get what you want without <em>wanting</em> it. Magnifico has the exact same diagrammatic function as the Room in <em>Stalker</em>, the one that will fulfil your most fundamental desire, even though you don’t know what that is. We hear about a stalker named Porcupine whose brother had died in the Zone. ‘One fine day Porcupine came back from here and suddenly became rich. Unbelievably rich. And after a week, he hanged himself.’ He thought his innermost desire would be to bring his brother back. ‘He crawled on his knees in this very puddle begging for his brother.’ But all he got was money. He did not, in fact, want what he wanted to want. It wouldn’t even make sense to say that what he <em>truly</em> wanted was the money, since money is just a universal equivalent, the possibility of other things. Receiving the money just means that he didn’t really want anything in particular at all.</p><p>This is why I’m not on board with a certain reactionary mode of culture-critique hat you see a lot of these days. This critique would agree with everything I’ve said about how Disney is replacing romantic desire with a deranged focus on the self. But it would add: all we need to do is <em>go back</em>. Everything was fine, before Marxism and feminism and postmodernism ruined our precious cartoons. We just need to reaffirm desire and the ordinary heterosexual relation, which is simple and natural and uncomplicated and good. This makes for a very popular strain of cretinous political polemic, but it’s unworthy of psychoanalysis. You can blame the present state of things on your ideological enemies, if you like. But you don’t get to pretend that there are any obvious answers, or any arrangements that aren’t shot through with aporias and ambivalence. Remember that the ordinary, neurotic sexual relation is one in which you’re constantly trying to <em>extinguish</em> the other’s desire. This is what you secretly wanted all along; the asexual nightmare of the present is just the <em>fulfilment</em> of the neurotic’s dreams. It’s ‘the approach by the obsessional to his desire which ensures that every step toward it makes it vanish.’ Magnifico really is Napoleon; he’s a Napoleon who finally won.</p><p>So, while both <em>Stalker </em>and <em>Wish </em>also stage the <em>reappearance</em> of desire, they do so without illusions: in both cases it’s in the form of a monstrosity. Desire is not nice! After the stalker’s final dirge for the will and the wish that are, even in the Soviet Union, on their way out—‘Nobody believes. Nobody! Whom should I lead in there? Oh, God, the most terrible thing is that nobody needs it any more, nobody needs that Room, and all my efforts are in vain!’—Tarkovsky shows us his daughter. The Zone-child, freaky and telekinetic, deformed by the poisoned land her father walks. The power that makes wishes come true has blasted her DNA. She sits under falling particles, princess of the infinite realms of desire, and knocks bottles off the table with her mind. She is the one who really doesn’t need the Room: when you have psychic powers, there’s no structural gap between the desire and its realisation. She reads a poem to us, one by Fyodor Tyutchev:</p><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text"><em>Люблю глаза твои, мой друг,
С игрой их пламенно-чудесной,
Когда их приподымешь вдруг
И, словно молнией небесной,
Окинешь бегло целый круг...
Но есть сильней очарованья:
Глаза, потупленные ниц
В минуты страстного лобзанья,
И сквозь опущенных ресниц
Угрюмый, тусклый огнь желанья.

Your eyes, my friend, I love, 
Their magic play of flames, 
When suddenly they look up, 
And like a heavenly lightning, 
Hastily look all around...
But there is a stronger spell: 
The downcast eyes 
In moments of the passionate kiss, 
When there through the lowered eyelashes 
Burns a dreadful, dim fire of the wish.</em></pre></div><p><em>Wish</em>, meanwhile, represents sexual desire as a star, the one that falls to earth when Asha makes her wish. (Not to belabour the point, but this is precisely the same event that, in <em>Stalker</em>, produces the wish-granting Zone: an object falling from the sky. ‘What was it? A meteorite, or a visitation from outer space? Whatever it was, in our small land there appeared a miracle of miracles: the Zone.’) The star is a tiny glowing creature of ‘hope and possibility and wonder inside the most loving light.’ It is also <em>terrifying</em>. Disney’s animators have done everything they can to make this star seem nonthreatening and adorable, but the first thing every single character experiences on first being exposed to the star is <em>fear</em>. Asha shrinks back in terror. Her friends grimace. One of them flees; the star chases him. They are right to be afraid. This star is made of joy and life: terrible, overflowing joy and life. Everything it touches becomes animate. Mushrooms blink sleepy eyes; slits of mouths open in their caps and speak. Wild animals perform synchronised dances. Hard to imagine the full horror of this thing. The contagion zone where it landed, where the smokestacks of ruined factories twist in the wind and scream. Where buildings claw at the ground. Where the roads writhe like worms. Where every scrap of rubble is alive, at war with the world, desperately yearning. Where there is no rest even in death. You will still dance when the flesh is shredded from your bones. Everything bursting with light. Lacan imagines the libido, ‘immortal life, or irrepressible life,’ as a kind of membrane born alongside the actual human being, ‘something extra-flat, which moves like the amoeba.’ An alien. Something monstrous. Something foreign and excessive, which doesn’t really <em>need</em> to be there; perhaps it would be better if it weren’t. And art, too, is something monstrous and excessive that does not need to be there.</p><p>Look: I do <em>realise</em> that <em>Wish</em> is a very bad film for children, and <em>Napoleon</em> is a very bad film as well. I realise that I’ve spent thousands of words getting far too into the weeds with a piece of disposable dogshit whose writers didn’t try any harder than ‘throw caution to every warning sign.’ I am not under any illusions here. But these terrible films still give me a strange hope, because <em>I’ve seen what passes for good</em>. I sat through <em>Past Lives</em>. I endured <em>Oppenheimer</em>. Everything subordinated to the pleasure principle; a sterile culture that demands praise for only colouring inside the lines. I really do think that the dominion of this stuff is ending, and we might be less enslaved than we were to the demand that everything make palpable <em>sense</em>. Small irruptions of chaos: the overdetermined, the indeterminate. Maybe this requires things that are in some sense <em>bad</em>, lazy, ill-conceived, poorly executed, things that don’t just present a perfectly smooth face. I think it’s a very encouraging sign that Disney, the same studio that bleached all the menace and ambiguity out of Hans Christian Anderson and the Grimms, is now giving us glimpses of a terrifying inorganic pleasure from beyond the realms of comprehension. It might be the disasters that save us. Our planet might still collide with a burning star. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ca043-63ef-49fe-ac86-9aab32854e83_1602x792.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ca043-63ef-49fe-ac86-9aab32854e83_1602x792.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ca043-63ef-49fe-ac86-9aab32854e83_1602x792.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ca043-63ef-49fe-ac86-9aab32854e83_1602x792.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ca043-63ef-49fe-ac86-9aab32854e83_1602x792.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ca043-63ef-49fe-ac86-9aab32854e83_1602x792.png" width="1456" height="720" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5b1ca043-63ef-49fe-ac86-9aab32854e83_1602x792.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1920685,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ca043-63ef-49fe-ac86-9aab32854e83_1602x792.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ca043-63ef-49fe-ac86-9aab32854e83_1602x792.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ca043-63ef-49fe-ac86-9aab32854e83_1602x792.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ca043-63ef-49fe-ac86-9aab32854e83_1602x792.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div>

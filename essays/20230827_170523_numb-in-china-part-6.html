For a while, it looked like the twenty-first century would see the world heave back to its traditional setup, the way things stood for thousands of years before the brief blip we call the Industrial Revolution: China would be at the centre, and everywhere else would be on the edge. But now, the mood has shifted: the Chinese economy is on the verge of stagnation, and the shaking of the world is, at the very least, on pause. Why did this happen? What does it mean? And what ancient spirits might be teeming in the gap between expectation and outcome?</em></p><p><em>From now until September, Numb at the Lodge will be in China, investigating these questions and more. Paid subscribers can join us in a brain-melting tourist odyssey across the past and future of Chinas real and imagined. This is a travel blog now.</em></p><div><hr></div><p>Today I’m writing from Guangzhou in the Pearl River Delta, where I have been haunted by fox-spirits.</p><p>Guangzhou is the China people imagine when they imagine China. Hot, shirtless alleyways; menus that contain every living animal and a few mythological ones; faded old Art Deco buildings wreathed in telephone wire; fish heads in the gutters; fermenting, numerous, busy. This place is slightly shabby, in its old core at least, but it’s also tremendously rich. The metro is gleaming and futuristic; there are skyscrapers in the shape of enormous coins that tingle with multicoloured lights like cuttlefish at night. One-twentieth of all global exports come out of this estuary. The Pearl Delta is the gasping mouth of the world economy: spewed out or sucked in, everything that exists passes through here. </p><p>It’s become very tedious to keep observing how much China has changed in the last few decades, but it really has changed, and this is where the change began. One of the books I’ve been reading here is an account of a Chinese writer’s travels across the country in the early 1980s, and the China he describes is unrecognisable: poor, unfathomably poor, a dusty landscape of mud huts and unpaved roads, sweltering one-room apartments with shared latrines down the hall, three families to each electric fan, where women are kidnapped from train stations and sold off for marriage, and where dancing too intimately in your own home could carry a jail sentence. But across China, people keep whispering about the new special economic zone in the Pearl River Delta: there, they wear business suits instead of blue tunics, your boss at the factory is called a <em>manager</em>, and you can pick up Hong Kong soap operas on your TV. At the beginning of the 1980s, Guangzhou was a medium-sized port city surrounded by rice paddies and fishing villages, not much bigger than Liverpool; today it’s just one fragment of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Zuhai-Foshan-Dongguan-Zhongshan-Jiangmen-Huizhou-Zhaoqing-Hong Kong-Macau gigacity, a rash of nearly contiguous high-density cyberpunk sprawl that’s broken out across the region, larger than the average European country, home to nearly seventy million people: easily the biggest conurbation on the planet. Now there’s an entire mall in Guangzhou devoted to sex shops, and another filled with creepy figurines of anime girls, each with a skirt you can peer up to gawp at her tiny, hard, injection-moulded buttocks. What an age. What a world. </p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>But lately, something’s gone off the rails. China’s economy is no longer growing like a demon; there have been points in the last few years when—for the first time since the Cultural Revolution—it’s stalled altogether. China’s working-age population has already started to shrink. As the rate of profit declines, an increasing proportion of state and private-sector funds are taken up with servicing debt, which is now inching towards 300% of GDP. The real estate industry is in collapse. China now has all the endemic problems and paralyses of a developed, first-world, postindustrial economy, but it is not a developed first-world postindustrial economy: despite the last few decades of extraordinary growth, China’s GDP per capita is still somewhere under $13,000, putting it roughly between Turkmenistan and the Maldives. And I think that somehow, the foxes might be involved. </p><p>This might sound like a tangent, but we need to talk about foxes. The most common fox species in China is the red fox, <em>Vulpes vulpes</em>: the exact same creature that inhabits the cities of England and makes a mess of our bins. But Chinese folklore acknowledges what every drunk Londoner who’s ever come face-to-face with a fox at four in the morning already knows: that foxes are not ordinary animals, but mythical, supernatural beings. Humans are the only animal to deliberately create an entire environment around our desires, but despite it all we’re still miserable and alienated in our cities. The foxes, meanwhile, seem right at home. The way they meet your gaze with your own; a fox’s laughing lack of fear. They might have powers beyond anything we can understand.</p><p>In China, a 狐狸精, or fox spirit, is simply an ordinary fox that’s lived long enough to gain extraordinary abilities. After a hundred years, a fox can freely take on human form; if it lives for a thousand years, it can become immortal. There are small shrines to fox-spirits across China, and also horror stories about malicious foxes that haunt houses and spread destruction. Because foxes live in the eerie mystical hours just before daybreak, their efforts at immortality are always hampered by their deficit of yang, the masculine principle of sunlight and warmth. So sometimes foxes will steal a man’s life-force by transforming into a beautiful woman and draining him of semen until he dies. Foxes can be wise, loyal, even beloved; it’s a good idea to speak respectfully about them, since you might end up marrying one. But they still belong to the night.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0603672-23ed-440b-b03c-ab961dd5e36f_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0603672-23ed-440b-b03c-ab961dd5e36f_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0603672-23ed-440b-b03c-ab961dd5e36f_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0603672-23ed-440b-b03c-ab961dd5e36f_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0603672-23ed-440b-b03c-ab961dd5e36f_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0603672-23ed-440b-b03c-ab961dd5e36f_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d0603672-23ed-440b-b03c-ab961dd5e36f_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:537665,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0603672-23ed-440b-b03c-ab961dd5e36f_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0603672-23ed-440b-b03c-ab961dd5e36f_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0603672-23ed-440b-b03c-ab961dd5e36f_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0603672-23ed-440b-b03c-ab961dd5e36f_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Here are some stories about foxes.</p><p>The first story is about a young man named Wang, who was a constant misery to his parents. Instead of studying for the imperial examinations, or finding himself a wife, he preferred to mope around the house, sighing at the stones and the trees and everything under heaven. Soon their mood was as black as his, so they enlisted the help of his cousin, Wu, who promised to take Wang out to the next county to enjoy the Lantern Festival, and maybe show him that life has its pleasures as well as its sorrows. Wang moped and complained all through the journey, and when they arrived he yawned that a few paper lanterns and glutinous rice balls were nothing to get excited about. But just as he was about to leave, he saw in a flash the most beautiful girl he had ever seen, being hustled by dark figures past the celebrations. Their eyes met for only a second, but in that second she dropped her spray of plum-blossoms to the ground for him, and smiled. Then she was gone.</p><p>After that day, Wang was much, much worse. Frenzied and feverish, weeping that since he could never learn the girl’s name or see her face again, he would have to die. But Wu knew very well who the girl was: she was the daughter of the Marquis, who would never allow her to marry a lazy commoner like Wang. So in desperation he lied, and told Wang that the girl was in fact a cousin of theirs who lived in a neighbouring county. Ecstatic, Wang decided to find her. He ran off into the hills in his sickclothes, with the sweat still clammy on his face. And before very long, he saw the plum-blossom girl again.</p><p>She was exactly where Wu had said she would be, in a little village near the frontier, gathering wildflowers by a stream. She called out to him, and asked if he’d liked the plum blossoms she’d left. He said he’d kissed them until they died, but she didn’t seem to know what kissing was, and still less about death. She told Wang that she lived with her blind and half-deaf stepmother, who had forbidden her from leaving the village without a dozen fearsome chaperones. The sky was dark now, and she invited Wang to stay the night, but warned that there was only one bed, which belonged to the stepmother. She and Wang would have to squeeze in together on the storeroom floor. Wang agreed.</p><p>Wang introduced himself very courteously to the blind stepmother as her devoted nephew, and she mashed her gums together and wailed. Then the girl showed him their storeroom, and he was astounded. The house was very humble, but this storeroom had richly painted columns, and a floor scattered with down as soft as clouds. Hundreds of gold and jade coins hung on silk ribbons from the ceiling, and the girl seemed to have no idea of the treasures she possessed. </p><p>They laid down to sleep. A moment later, Wang asked: Before, you asked what a kiss was—shall I show you? And he planted a long kiss on her lips. But the girl still seemed confused about what a kiss was for, so he tore open her clothes and immediately thrust himself inside her. As soon as he did, though, he felt a terrible pain, and saw a thick spurt of blood from his groin.</p><p>When Wu had told his lie, he hadn’t known that an army of bandits had poured over the frontier not long after the Lantern Festival, to slaughter the Marquis and his pretty daughter, and pile up corpses where paper lanterns and glutinous rice balls had been. Then they had fanned out across the countryside, burning every village they encountered, until a detachment of imperial troops arrived and scared them back over the frontier. But the villages they had ransacked were still in ruins. The only ones who had moved back were foxes from the mountains, and they had come to scavenge the dead: to eat their flesh and crunch their bones. Foxes like the creature that had appeared to Wang as the plum-blossom girl. </p><p>Wang had never touched the girl. Instead, he had been embracing a hollow log, with a bandit’s arrowhead lodged inside; as he tried to fuck it the sharp blade had sliced his cock in two from tip to root. The fox, with its sharp teeth and filthy fur, lapped at the curdled mixture of semen and blood. And not far off, the only human inhabitant of the village left alive sat in the wet wreckage of her peasant bed, blind to all Wang’s misery. She mashed her gums together and wailed.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff682fdf2-c225-4246-934b-3363fff9ccbe_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff682fdf2-c225-4246-934b-3363fff9ccbe_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff682fdf2-c225-4246-934b-3363fff9ccbe_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff682fdf2-c225-4246-934b-3363fff9ccbe_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff682fdf2-c225-4246-934b-3363fff9ccbe_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff682fdf2-c225-4246-934b-3363fff9ccbe_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f682fdf2-c225-4246-934b-3363fff9ccbe_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:336923,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff682fdf2-c225-4246-934b-3363fff9ccbe_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff682fdf2-c225-4246-934b-3363fff9ccbe_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff682fdf2-c225-4246-934b-3363fff9ccbe_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff682fdf2-c225-4246-934b-3363fff9ccbe_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Another story is about another young loser named Luo. When Luo was sixteen years old, his uncle—who loved him, and had raised him like a son—gave him a small bag of money and a letter of introduction, and told him to present himself before the provincial magistrate. Instead, Luo met a famous courtesan on the road, fell in love, and followed her all the way to Nanjing. For the few months he could still afford her, he was magnificently happy. Then his uncle’s money ran out, and huge weeping sores burst all over his body. For years, he begged on the street. He ate from the refuse piles. He did not expect to live long. But it would be terrible to die so far from home, so he begged and hobbled back along the same road until eventually he was outside his uncle’s door. The thought of being received in his present condition was unbearable. He fled into the mountains.</p><p>While wandering between temples for alms, Luo met a beautiful young woman, who told him that she had also renounced the world and invited him to stay with her in her mountain cave. He knew that she could only be a fox, and that foxes prey on weak men like him, but he was exhausted and accepted the offer. When he arrived, he found that the woman’s cave was bright and pleasant, even though there were no fires or torches to be seen. The floor of the cave was perfectly clean, but there was no furniture at all, just a pile of large green leaves stacked in one corner.</p><p>The woman tore a few strips from the leaves and wrapped them around Luo’s body, from head to foot. As soon as they were on, he noticed that they didn’t feel like leaves, but silk bandages. Then she took a huge leaf and with a small pair of scissors she carefully cut out the shape of a bed. When Luo laid down on it, it was the most comfortable bed he’d ever had. She cut out the shape of a bowl, and filled it from a mountain stream so he could drink. Finally, exhausted, Luo slept.</p><p>In the morning, he removed his silken bandages to find that all his sores and wounds had vanished, and he had the healthy body of a virile young man again. He was also feeling some of his old desires. When he tried to jump on her, the fox-woman laughed. Silly boy! she said. But she was a fox. She followed him to bed.</p><p>For a long time they were happy together. She cut a shirt out of leaves for him, and it felt soft and cool against his skin. When he was hungry, she would cut out a fish or some rice cakes. In the summer, she made him extravagant furniture and golden goblets fit for the Emperor’s court. But the cold months were lean: when the leaves fell from the trees, they had to gather as many as possible, or they would have nothing to eat all winter. Then spring came again, and the budding leaves became gemstones and pomegranate-seeds, and the fox-woman gave birth to the most beautiful baby boy Luo had ever seen.</p><p>Luo loved his son. But as the years went on, he started to think about all the opportunities he’d squandered: why should his son have to live in a distant mountain cave just because of Luo’s intemperance as a young man? Luo had gold and jewels and fine clothes now, and a son who was stronger and more handsome by the day; he could present himself before his uncle’s door without any shame. His son could grow up to be a magistrate. But the fox wouldn’t hear it. He is a fox-child, she said, his place is here. So by day Luo taught his son to gather leaves and sing fox-songs, but by night, in secret, he taught him to read and write. He began making plans to leave.</p><p>He told the fox that their son should at least learn to ride, and she agreed, cutting out a proud, steaming stallion. Then he said that they could gather leaves better with a bag, and she cut him out a magical sack that would never fill up and never grew heavy no matter what you put inside. Finally, one night, he collected all their furniture and jewellery and put it in the sack. Then he woke their son, and together they rode back to the human world.</p><p>It was just before daybreak when they arrived at Luo’s uncle’s town. As soon as Luo passed the city gates, he noticed that the horse was slowing and struggling to breathe. Before his eyes, its skin started to roughen, until suddenly it was no longer a horse but a pile of old, dusty, dried-up leaves. So they walked. As Luo approached his uncle’s street, the sack in his hand became another dead leaf, with hundreds of stinking rotting leaves stuffed inside. He dropped it and carried on. Outside his uncle’s door, his fine robes became brown shreds of leaves, and the skin underneath was once again covered with weeping red sores, but still Luo knocked on the door. And just as his uncle opened it, a single golden leaf peeled away from the skin of his son’s face, and then the boy was nothing but leaves, scattering in the autumn wind.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6808d37a-28ae-4670-b515-79a5d5c3d6b1_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6808d37a-28ae-4670-b515-79a5d5c3d6b1_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6808d37a-28ae-4670-b515-79a5d5c3d6b1_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6808d37a-28ae-4670-b515-79a5d5c3d6b1_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6808d37a-28ae-4670-b515-79a5d5c3d6b1_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6808d37a-28ae-4670-b515-79a5d5c3d6b1_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6808d37a-28ae-4670-b515-79a5d5c3d6b1_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:367993,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6808d37a-28ae-4670-b515-79a5d5c3d6b1_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6808d37a-28ae-4670-b515-79a5d5c3d6b1_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6808d37a-28ae-4670-b515-79a5d5c3d6b1_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6808d37a-28ae-4670-b515-79a5d5c3d6b1_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The third story concerns a scholar named Li, who held a minor provincial office. Li’s family had never been poor, but they had never been truly rich either; he found it hard to keep up the luxury that was expected of a man in his position. So his clothes were very fine, but his house was slowly falling apart, and the beautiful gardens an ancestor had planted had gone to waste, strangled by weeds and scattered with crumbling stones.</p><p>One day, an old man presented himself at Li’s door and said he was looking for a place to live. He offered one hundred silver taels to rent the ruined garden, far more than it could possibly be worth. Confused but grateful, Li accepted. The next day, the local people saw a procession of magnificent carriages winding along the road to Li’s old garden, with trumpeters and footmen in shining silks, and great proud horses with foaming lips. Hearing the news, Li rushed over to his garden, but found nothing: no grand procession, just weeds and broken stones and animal screams.</p><p>A week later, the same old man appeared at Li’s door. He begged Li’s forgiveness, and said that his family had been so busy setting up their new home, they hadn’t had the opportunity to entertain him as they should have. But, he said, they were nicely settled in now, and it would gladden the old man immensely if he could have the honour of hosting Li that evening.</p><p>So that evening Li walked to his old ruined garden, and found that it had been transformed. Dozens of new buildings had been erected in just a few days, beautiful painted halls with handsome gatehouses and elegant courtyards. Gentle lanterns hung from the eaves, and the garden was thronged with people, young girls laughing, elders playing weiqi in the evening cool. The old man beckoned him over, and he and his daughters served Li a dinner of eighty-eight courses. All his daughters were beautiful; they could sing and play the zheng. Li understood that they must all be foxes: he had let his ancestor’s garden become a fox’s den.</p><p>So he decided to get rid of them. Every time he went to the market, he bought a little saltpetre, until before long he had a huge quantity of the stuff, and finally he took it to the garden. During the day, when the foxes were not weaving their magic, the garden was a worse wreck than ever before: now riddled with messy holes and littered with the scat of foxes. Li scattered his saltpetre across the entire place, but especially around the foxholes, and set it all alight. And where there had been a garden, there was suddenly nothing but black smoke and stinking dust and screams, and when Li returned he was proud to see the charred bodies of hundreds of foxes, some of them still smouldering, littered across his land. But then he saw something moving in the wreckage. It was the old man, and there were tears pouring from his eyes.</p><p>What have you done? he asked. Why would you do something like this? All I wanted was a home. I paid you far more than your land was worth. I built many good dwellings on what had been a wasteland. I invited you to my home for a fine dinner. I introduced you to my family. And in return, you kill them all? How could you do something so cruel? And with that, he was gone.</p><p>But killing the foxes seemed to have brought Li nothing but luck. He found himself ascending to higher and higher positions, until eventually he was appointed governor of his entire province. His wealth multiplied. He married the daughter of a duke and had four strapping sons. Eventually he began to consider that his ancestral home, which was still slowly falling apart, hardly befitted a man of his stature. He decided to tear it down and build a new one.</p><p>It just so happened that a famous architect was passing through the province, and after hearing about Li’s decision the architect presented himself at the governor’s door with a stack of letters of introduction as thick as a man’s thigh. He said that Li had clearly been favoured by Heaven, and that such an extraordinary man should have the most extraordinary house in China. In the distant western kingdom of Falan Xi, the architect said, the great king Lu Yi had built himself a palace of silver and glass; if Li wished, the architect would build such a palace for him. Li did wish. The architect said he would supply all his own materials and labourers, and that since building a palace for such an august personage was its own reward, he would only ask for a token fee—say, one hundred silver taels.</p><p>Work began the very next day. A horde of men descended on Li’s ancestral home like a rampaging army and dismantled it. The family shrines were tossed with the rest of the rotting old beams and burned; the ground was levelled, and then they began to build. Instead of the usual courtyards, the palace was laid out with long galleries, which the architect said was the style of the mysterious lands of the west. Struts of silver and stone, immense mirrors, huger panels of crystalline glass. In one week, all work was complete. Li wandered through his new home, with its walls of shining glass, so clear that he could see into every inch of the palace from its every point. It was magnificent.</p><p>Finally Li organised a grand reception in honour of his extraordinary residence. Relatives and lackeys came from six provinces to gawp at this wonder. But once everyone had arrived and the halls were teeming, Li noticed that it was starting to get hot. The sun shone bright through the roof, and steam rose from the crowd until it condensed on the walls and everyone was bathed in sweat. Soon it was difficult to breathe. The guests tried opening the doors, but they held fast; they tried smashing the glass walls to escape, but the panes were strong and refused to budge. Panic rose. The guests pushed and shoved and clawed at each other like animals, they gasped and shrieked, and slowly they boiled in their own skins until every one of them was dead. And the architect, who was of course none other than the old fox, slunk away with his revenge.</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;cbb72659-11b5-4978-aa53-da7adbcad810&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p>There are a few things we can learn from these stories. Foxes are not always malicious, but you still can’t trust anything they show you, and you should be wary of accepting their generous offers. A fox can scatter images of wealth and plenty and all your dreams fulfilled, and it might not even be lying, but it belongs to a stranger world than ours, a twilit world beyond real and fake. They are, like all animals, innocent. But I think to really understand my encounter with the fox-spirit, you have to understand the Chinese real estate bubble. </p><p>Unfortunately, I do not even slightly understand the Chinese real estate bubble, so most of what I experienced is a mystery to me. All I know is this. In the West, we’re still used to thinking of the Chinese economy as one based on manufacturing, because most of the time when we encounter China in our economic lives it’s through made-in-China <em>stuff</em>, even if that stuff now consists of smartphones and electric cars rather than cheap plastic crap. But actually the Chinese economy is dominated by real estate, which contributed 30% of national GDP at its peak. (Even in the UK, which is basically a property market with a state loosely attached, the figure is around 20%.) Actually, though, the two aren’t really separate. The capital for China’s extraordinary manufacturing boom in the late twentieth century mostly came from local governments, and local government incomes were almost entirely provided by a massive sell-off of state-owned land to private developers.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> Meanwhile, industrial labour was provided by a huge migration of millions of rural workers into the cities, who would then live in the vast complexes of new apartment blocks. Housing funded industry; industry would keep the housing boom going. This was why there were such intense struggles over home evictions: every peasant who refused to leave his hovel so it could be turned into a skyscraper was blocking the entire country’s path to prosperity. But in fact, the frenzy of the mass sell-off meant that new real estate was being built far in excess of actual need. And because China lacks a well-developed bond market, almost all private investment is in residential real estate, which artificially inflates the price of this utterly useless housing. Here in Guangzhou, the median residential property costs 37 times the median household income; in Shanghai it’s 47 times; while in famously unaffordable London it’s a measly 16. China’s epoch-defining industrial growth was premised on an enormous housing bubble, and in 2020, the government decided to pop it. In August that year, it introduced its Three Red Lines policy, which prevented property developers from borrowing more than 100% of the value of their assets. This was guaranteed to throw some of the country’s biggest developers into crisis, which is exactly what it did—but with the manufacturing sector still churning, the country should have been able to absorb the shocks. Unfortunately, the forced deflation of the speculative bubble was almost immediately followed by wave after wave of sporadic, unpredictable, and chaotically managed covid lockdowns that crippled productive industries and left millions of people screaming like animals from the balconies of their homes. And now we’re here.</p><p>Or, at least, this is where you are. I’m not entirely sure where I’ve ended up.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7b963ba-cd15-4ca3-ba35-1ae9dc75f574_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7b963ba-cd15-4ca3-ba35-1ae9dc75f574_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7b963ba-cd15-4ca3-ba35-1ae9dc75f574_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7b963ba-cd15-4ca3-ba35-1ae9dc75f574_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7b963ba-cd15-4ca3-ba35-1ae9dc75f574_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7b963ba-cd15-4ca3-ba35-1ae9dc75f574_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d7b963ba-cd15-4ca3-ba35-1ae9dc75f574_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:187324,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7b963ba-cd15-4ca3-ba35-1ae9dc75f574_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7b963ba-cd15-4ca3-ba35-1ae9dc75f574_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7b963ba-cd15-4ca3-ba35-1ae9dc75f574_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7b963ba-cd15-4ca3-ba35-1ae9dc75f574_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Yesterday, I took a taxi into one of the high-rise outskirts of Guangzhou. I was supposed to be meeting someone out there, a friend of a friend of a friend, a Chinese property speculator called Yan who’d lost everything and was now living out of a studio apartment in some faceless suburban commuter hive. The driver was a short, wire-thin man who kept grinning at me in the rear-view mirror in a way that didn’t feel entirely comfortable, and was also driving like a maniac. (Last time, I mentioned that in China there’s no social taboo on pushing in front of people in a line; I forgot to say that the same applies on the road. The road markings are mostly used as guidelines to help you more efficiently collide with other cars. Here, if someone’s overtaking you, the done thing is to <em>speed up</em> so they can’t get ahead.) Eventually, I noticed the blue location marker on my phone zoom directly past my destination and keep on going. I tried saying something about this to the driver, but he kept grinning at me in the mirror, and laughing OK OK, all OK, all OK. For about a minute his bright copper-red gaze didn’t leave mine. Still staring directly at me, he wheeled us off the freeway and through a dense thicket of identical prefabricated high-rise blocks, as the blue location marker ballooned in size to cover the entire Pearl Delta gigacity and then vanished altogether. The doors were locked; not even my phone knew where I was. I began to consider the kind of ransom I’d be willing to pay for my own kidneys. </p><p>But nobody took a knife to my abdomen. Instead, the driver pulled up in the middle of a desolate concrete plaza, took his ninety yuan, and then booted me out of the car and drove off. I was left in the middle of a towering stone circle of blank forty-storey apartment buildings, all frowning down on me as if they expected a sacrifice. Small puffs of moss escaped from the gaps in the concrete paving. A few slabs had cracked down the middle, and puddles of brownish water had collected in the crease, fringed with green slime. I walked to the base of one of the towers: it was boarded up. So on a baking hot day, with no signal on my phone and a quarter-litre of warm water left in my bag, I decided to keep walking. Eventually, I thought, I would find a road, or a metro station, and then I’d be able to make my way back to civilisation. </p><p>There wasn’t a road. Instead, once I got past the circle of housing units, I found myself in another empty plaza. This one had dozens of deformed, spindly trees growing from planters every fifty metres or so, each attached to a concrete staircase descending into some hidden layer beneath. I went down a few steps, then hovered on the edge of the next. The air down there was cool, but there was the smell of something rank, sulphurous, like piss and corpses. I tiptoed down a few more steps. The roar of air conditioning. Maybe, I thought, someone was living down there. Maybe all the residents here had escaped from their speculative high-rises into some underground world; maybe they had become cave-people, pale and bloated, licking moisture from the moss. I crept further down. The staircase opened up into another plaza, just as vast as the one above but underground, and just as empty. On the nearest wall, some kind of Party display was lit by the only functioning light in the place; beyond that, the buried plaza extended into the far chilly darkness. The smell was stronger now; I recognised the stink of foxes. In the distance, a fox’s strangled high-pitched cry, and then another, coming closer. I fled back up the stairs.</p><p>Wherever it was I’d arrived, space worked differently here; it was pixelated, all scrambled up. As I trudged on I encountered fragments of highway barely any longer than they were wide, and packed with cars: all with their engines on, blasting noise and heat, but empty, going nowhere. A long, meticulously laid-out pavement would continue for half a kilometre, generously planted with flowerbeds and crap public sculpture, and then abruptly end in the middle of an empty beanfield or near a fenced-off compound of high unfinished blocks. Some of the towers, I noticed, were only half there. One entire face of a building might be missing, revealing a dense honeycomb of apartments with imitation-wood floors and minimalist Scandi-style furniture, now waterlogged and growing green things out the gaps. In one apartment that invisible line, between the part that existed and the part that did not, went right through the middle of a bed. Trails of wet stuffing, rusted springs. It was as if someone had started building a new city here, but instead of doing it in any sensible order they’d just filled in litle cells of wasteland with the city that was to be, all entirely at random, and then they’d suddenly stopped. A cloud might disappear across the patchwork sky, and then return in another corner, moving in a different direction. Somehow, I had been brought into the halfway world, on the hungry knife’s edge where nothing is whole.</p><p>Eventually it got dark, and the lights started to come on. The sound—always just around the corner—of traffic, street food sellers shouting, Chinese pop music leisure and life. Pink and purple lasers fanned the broken clouds, source indeterminate. I was getting desperate. The sounds of an ordinary city kept dragging me further into this maze, but every time I thought about turning around I heard the soft paws and knowing snickers of the foxes. They were trailing me now, casting just enough of a shadow for me to know they were there. Herding me like prey towards their goal. </p><p>But their goal was also mine. After an hour, half-walking, half-running, the foxes corralled me into the big circular plaza where I’d first arrived here. Only now there was a building, huge and shadowy in the twilight, at the centre of the plaza; a double-roofed Tang Dynasty palace. It was falling apart. Paint peeling in toxic flakes, wooden beams dripping and dense with weevils. Rats scurried in and out of the gaps in the tiled roof, and the floor was scattered with huge rocks and tiny animal bones. I walked glumly into the hall, ready now for whatever strange punishment the foxes had chosen to inflict on me, for whatever strange crepuscular reasons they had, when a sudden horrible apparition reared up in front of me. A figure all in rags, mud-splattered, blood-smeared, mumbling and stinking, but still recognisable. It was Yan, the property speculator, the one I’d come out here to meet. But Yan didn’t see me. He crunched blind across the field of bones and into a dark stinking cavern of the wreck, where he started swinging one arm around. Let’s have a beer, he muttered. He was miming the opening of a fridge door. Pulled open invisible drawers for a bottle opener, walked back towards me, swigging his imaginary beer. Tapped his hand on an enormous rotten column for the light. A fat black beetle skittered over his knuckles. Yan wandered into the middle of the ruin and threw himself down on a toppled fragment of an ancient scholar stone, now streaked white with guano. Ahh, he said, with some satisfaction. The sharp rock had cut a deep scrape into the back of Yan’s arm, and as he fiddled with an unreal TV remote, deep in the comfortable folds of his unreal sofa, safe in his unreal estate, the blood slowly dripped down past his elbow and onto the floor.</p><p>Hey honey, Yan said, do you wanna come and watch a movie with me?</p><p>And in one light gentle female voice, the foxes replied: Yes. </p><p>I’d thought I was the one in the trap, that this place was somehow designed for me. But in the end I was only a spectator, dumbly witnessing someone else’s story. I am a tourist. Afterwards, I sat in the back seat of the taxi and watched the lights of Guangzhou flash past my window. There was no visible break between the fox-city, the place the foxes had made for Yan, and the real one: the place outside my window was also fractured, also haphazardly piled up on itself and sliced off at unpredictable angles, also made of artifice and cruelty and dreams. Huge clusters of identical high-rise units sprouting from empty wasteland, dark as tombstones in the night. The taxi pulled up outside my hotel. I scanned the driver’s QR code. Xiexie, I said, getting out. Mei shi, said the fox. </p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Actually, almost all non-agricultural land in China is still owned by the state; what’s sold is the usufruct to that land—that is, the right to make money off it. </p><p></p></div></div>

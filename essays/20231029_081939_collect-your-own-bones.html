He preferred to live alone, in the hills and the forests, wandering from place to place. He was twenty years old in 971 when his aristocratic father killed another man in a duel. Suddenly the secular world, with all its pleasures and violence, felt like an insect crawling over his skin. He had to shrug it off. ‘Against you, unclean world, I protest!’ So Romuald became a hermit. He ate roots and herbs. He shat in ditches. Sometimes he lived in monasteries, where he would build an oratory in his cell and then wall himself in so he wouldn’t be seen. The people who tried to follow this strange, half-starved creature were subjected to terrible austerities. A man whose ambition it was, his hagiographer wrote, to make the world into one vast hermitage. Cold stone walls: chastity, mortification, and the Rule. Everyone in their own minuscule cell, all of us in our millions, in stark contemplation of God.</p><p>One day, a gang of peasants tried to kill him. Not because they hated Romuald; they might have even loved him. They knew that the mumbling hermit in their hills was the holiest man alive, and that after he died he would undoubtedly be made a saint. So they decided to speed the process along. Ambush him in the forest and bash in his skull. Chop the body into bits. Boil the flesh off the bones. Turn them into relics: bony images of a bony, unforgiving life. Any relic of the martyred St Romuald would be incredibly valuable. This wealth of metaphors inside his body, like a seam of gold waiting to be unearthed.</p><p>Romuald escaped. Five years after his eventual death in 1027, the monks decided to build a new altar over his body. When they opened his tomb, they found that the body had been miraculously preserved, unchanged since his death, except for a thin sheen of liquid over the holy man’s skin.</p><h4>The death of St Elizabeth</h4><p>Elizabeth of Hungary was fanatical in her charity. Every day, she gathered the bread from her table at Wartburg Castle and took it down into the village to feed the poor. She invited a leper to lie in her marital bed. She ranged over the country with armfuls of silk and ermine robes, laying them over the shoulders of mud-caked vagrants. Once, on a black cold day in the middle of winter, her husband caught her on one of her journeys, coming down the hill with her mantle stuffed with food. He knew she was taking his gold and jewellery to give away to the poor, so with one rough hand he tore open her cloak. God or his angels must have intervened, because the bread and diamonds vanished. Instead, a miraculous shower of red and white roses fell in cascades from her naked chest.</p><p>Elizabeth died in 1231, at the age of twenty-four. As she was lying in state, a crowd of worshippers came to touch her body and take her relics. They cut away strips from the linen bandages covering her face. They cut clipping from her fingernails. Holy objects, small pieces of her kindheartedness: she who had given everything. One by one, they cut off locks of her hair, until the corpse was ragged and bald. Eventually, someone produced a knife and cut off both her nipples.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><h4>The death of the pelican</h4><p>In the Middle Ages, the human body is only a vast heap of images. Everything is images. A plant that looks like a hand will cure diseases of the hand. A plant that looks like a kidney will cure diseases of the kidney. James of Viterbo tells us that when the pelican leaves its nest to find food, a snake will sometimes kill her chicks. The pelican mourns her children for three days, and then in sorrow she pierces her own breast with her beak; the blood trickles down her feathers onto the chicks and returns them to life. The pelican is a living image, a metaphor for Christ. Bleeding pelicans squat on top of painted crucifixes. Thomas Aquinas conjures the pelican in his hymns:</p><blockquote><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text"><em>Pie Pelicane, Jesu Domine,
Me immundum munda tuo sanguine.</em></pre></div></blockquote><p>The official religion of the European Middle Ages was Christianity. Its true religion was the luminous, luxurious image.</p><p>Medieval images are not illusionistic. They do not try to represent the direct spatial relationships between objects. The artists could have done that if they wanted, but why would they want to? What could be more miserable and impoverished than point-projection perspective? So the soldiers besieging a castle stand taller than the curtain walls. This is a luxury. They have become icons, metaphors, or relics. Like the saints that speak with their symbols: the keys for Peter, the book and the sword for Paul. Not a partial view of an object in space, but an expression of the thing in all its unrepresentable totality. Rich and shining, protected by a thin liquid sheen.</p><p>The tenth-century Vestibule Mosaic in the Hagia Sophia shows two emperors dedicating their works to the Virgin Mary. On the left, Justinian hands her the Hagia Sopia: the building that contains the mosaic itself. On the right, Constantine hands her the city of Constantinople, with its high walls and tall towers, the palaces and the endless sea of buildings vanishing into the gloomy distance: the city that contains the building that contains the mosaic. Both gifts are exactly the same size. Each emperor holds his gift gingerly, with two hands. The technical term is <em>mise en abyme</em>; plunged into the abyss. The recursive spaceless void where images teem.</p><p>The highest mode of image was the allegory: the medieval world is stalked by ambulatory ideas. If you stub your toe, you do not <em>feel pain;</em> there is Pain, a cruel empress on a throne guarded by lions, wearing a magnificent robe bejewelled with many balas and corundum rubies, whose sister is called Pleasure and lies wretched and weeping at the foot of her throne – and Pain reaches out from within this other geography and seizes your foot. Maybe the wall you stubbed yourself on has become the sword on her hip, or her terrifying crown, or the unbearable beauty in her eyes. She plants a single cruel kiss on the tip of your toe.</p><p>I am not even close to exaggerating. In 1418, mobs tore through Paris, massacring anyone suspected to support the House of Orléans. The Burgher of Paris describes the scene:</p><blockquote><p><em>Then arose the goddess of Discord, who lived in the tower of Evil Counsel, and awoke Wrath, the mad woman, and Covetousness and Rage and Vengeance, and they took up arms of all sorts and cast out Reason, Justice, Remembrance of God and Moderation most shamefully. Then Madness enraged, and Murder and Slaughter killed, cut down, put to death, massacred all they found in the prisons, and Covetousness tucked up her skirts into her belt with Rapine, her daughter, and Larceny, her son.</em></p></blockquote><p>Medieval images glow. A brighter, more intense era; a planet closer to the sun. The most richly <em>artificial</em> age in human history. Every piece of art from every subsequent period feels shabby, impoverished. <em>We </em>are the primitives, we moderns, with our bumbling attempts at realism. Fussy little novels about ordinary people dealing with their trauma. Stories without allegory or miracles. Joyless! But the Middle Ages produced nothing, from the Latin church histories to the <em>chansons de geste</em>, that was not pure pleasure to read.</p><p>In the romances, a young knight sets off in search of adventure. He is the most handsome and courtly man anyone has ever seen. He sits on the most powerful horse in the world. His saddle is draped in brocaded silks. He comes to a castle, the strongest and most well-appointed in the land, protected by a fast-flowing magic river they say no man could ever cross, and no horse can leap over. He crosses it in a single jump. In the castle, he is given lodgings by a kind vavasour. The vavasour’s daughter is more beautiful than any maiden ever formed by nature, with eyes that glow like twin stars and a face fairer than the lily-flower. There is a tournament; our knight competes for his lady’s honour. His first lance splinters. His second pierces the enemy’s armour, and his ribs, until its point tastes the blood of his heart.</p><p>This was not how life was actually lived, in this or any age. But the images shine clearly: they are real.</p><h4>The death of thousands</h4><p>A knight’s fee was the parcel of land and population required to sustain and outfit a single mounted, armoured warrior. The knight’s fee does not tend to appear in the romances; knights, good and bad, seem to emerge spontaneously out of the narrative landscape, like maggots from an old cheese. But it was always there.</p><p>Every knight in arms represented the surplus extracted from around six hundred acres and three hundred people. The corn, the fruit, the wine, the wood, the coal, the cloth, the iron, sometimes the women, sometimes the limbs, the blood. In capitalism, surpluses are appropriated by the capitalist through economic means—the wage relation—and then reinvested. More of everything, more goods, more profit, endless growth. In manorialism, surpluses are appropriated by the local military aristocrat through non-economic means—open physical force—and then used to produce only himself. Nothing grows. The surplus does not expand. He eats it all. The sole crystallisation of those six hundred acres and three hundred people was a man coated in a thick layer of padding and steel, capable of hoisting a ten-foot wooden lance and driving it into somebody’s flesh.</p><p>Until the fourteenth century, there was nothing that could touch a fully armoured knight in battle except another fully armoured knight. Virtually the entire economic output of every society was turned towards the production of more and better armoured knights. This vast social slaughter-machine gave itself a name: <em>chivalry</em>. Unbridled aristocratic joy in the fineness of everything, luxurious life and luxurious death:</p><blockquote><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text"><em>Honneur semont toute noble nature
D’aimer tout ce qui noble est en son estre.</em></pre></div></blockquote><p>Chivalry was built out of cruel expediency. It didn’t matter if they were supposed to be your enemies or your protectors: any group of mounted knights moved like a plague or a fire through the countryside, carrying off the stores, burning the huts, raping, killing. But at the same time, the chivalric spirit demanded a total refusal of calculation or self-interest; everything had to be sacrificed for the image. This age was proudly, actively insane. After the Battle of Crécy, hundreds of French knights were transported to England as hostages. And then the captors simply let them go, with nothing more than the promise that these captives would return home, extort a ransom from their lands and peasants, and make their way back to England to pay for their freedom. If they couldn’t scour up their ransoms, they were expected to hand themselves back to the prison. Once freed, every single one of them voluntarily returned.</p><p>But then something else arrived. The democratic pike, the commoner’s weapon, a long pole with something sharp at the end, that a few hastily assembled Flemish burghers could use to open up any haughty aristocrat like a tin of sardines. That was the beginning of realism, the crummy bean-counting bourgeois era in which the glowing images died.</p><h4>The death of Arthur</h4><p>Or maybe the Middle Ages were always ending. <em>Rhonabwy’s Dream</em> is the last of the medieval Welsh stories collected in the <em>Mabinogion</em>. It sits on the edge of something. In the <em>Llyfr Coch Hergest</em>, fifty pages separate it from the rest of the tales. The other stories were told aloud from generation to generation, and then written down, but this one was born on the page, to be read aloud from the page. It belongs to a different mode of cultural production. The author tells us, in his final words: ‘No one knows the dream – neither poet nor storyteller – without a book.’</p><p>This is an Arthur tale, but we begin far from that brighter world. We’re in Powys, in the ordinary twelfth century, when the sons of Maredudd ap Bleddyn went to war. Rhonabwy is riding in the countryside with his companions; he comes to a house, but there’s no kind vavasour and no beautiful daughter:</p><blockquote><p><em>When they came inside they could see an uneven floor, full of holes; where there was a bump in the floor, scarcely could a man stand up, so slippery was the floor with the dung of cattle and their piss. Where there was a hole, a man would go over his ankle, what with the mixture of water and cattle-piss. When they examined their sleeping-place there was on it only dusty, flea-infested straw-ends, mixed with bits of twig, the cattle having devoured all the straw that was above their heads and below their feet. A greyish-red blanket, rough and threadbare and full of holes, was spread on it. And they went to sleep.</em></p></blockquote><p>In this bed, Rhonabwy dreams the Battle of Camlan, where King Arthur died. Now there are knights in fine colours with brocaded silk and magical jewels, who tower over Rhonabwy and his men. ‘I feel so sad,’ Arthur says, ‘that scum such as these are protecting this Island after such fine men that protected it in the past.’ But this Arthur is old, and he doesn’t do much fighting either. The sky darkens as the enemies approach. Arthur sits and plays a game of <em>gwyddbwyll</em>, while ravens tear his men to shreds.</p><p>Rhonabwy wakes up in the ruined house with cattle-piss sloshing on the floor. In the end, it was only a dream.</p><p>Which is easy for us to say, now. But another Welsh tale describes a boy who, while wandering, found a gap in the rocks that nobody else had ever seen. Crawling inside, he found himself in a vast hall of stone where thousands of men in terrible spiked armour lay as if they had died in a heap, each clasping a switch of hazel. Arthur’s army. Frightened, the boy started to run for daylight, but he hit his head on a large bell suspended from the roof of the cavern. It clanged loud enough to shake the earth, and at once the men jumped up and started to shout: ‘Is this the day? Has it dawned? Is this the day?’ No, the boy managed, this is not the day. The warriors went back to sleep. The boy pined away and died not long after he emerged from the cave. The day those men were waiting for has not yet dawned. We are still in their long strange fitful dream.</p><h4>The death of the present</h4><p>But there is something medieval in the air again. The great project of bourgeois modernity was to clear out all the luxurious artifice of the medieval era, to deal with things stoically and empirically. Realism in art; clockwork cosmology; good sensible fiscal management. Wherever it is we’ve landed in the third decade of the twenty-first century, it’s not there.</p><p>This is the neofeudalism thesis: that the long era of capitalist growth has finally stalled, and now it’s decaying into something else. Europe is in terminal stasis, America is bogged in its empire, even China is starting to sputter out. There are no great surpluses left to reinvest. What’s vanishing is the sense that we are progressing <em>somewhere</em>, that capitalism has any futures left to show us. We slip grumbling into a slower, more cyclical world. We sink from gold to bronze to lead. In the advanced economies, the basis is no longer production, but <em>rent</em>. The working classes are no longer the active economic and political force in society, but a grudgeful mass of half-educated and heretical peasants, screen-staring serfs who must be prodded and jabbed into giving up more and more of the last crumbs they still possess. Appropriation on a vast, vast scale, new realms of appropriation cracked open by digital technology and the surveillance state. Everything you have is rented from the lord in his manor, who now wants more than your barley and your butter. He demands a his rightful chunk of your data, your attention, your cognition, your self-identity, your finite and shrinking time.</p><p>The economic analogy is contested, but there is an undeniable medieval <em>vibe</em> to our age. It took one great global plague to wrench us out of that world, and another to put as back in. And here we are. Chainmail on the catwalk, skinny girls with psalters, Ottessa Moshfegh’s <em>Lapvona</em>, tradcaths; the new anchorites, chaste and alone in their dark cells, contemplating the white private light of the screen; the glut of new chivalric codes refining the male urge to conquer and destroy. But there’s more to it: we are once again under the spell of the <em>image</em>, its luxurious virtualities. Sex is a distant image of porn. Sociality is a metaphor for the phone. We communicate in dense, non-illusionistic icons. And you are simply the raw materials for your self-identity, your online presentation, the shining image with its thin liquid sheen. Piece by piece, you feed your body into this reliquary. You collect your own bones.</p><p>It might not be so bad, this second senescence of the world, if we can learn to worship idols again, if we can find their hidden seams of luxury and joy.</p><p>They say the head of Bendigeidfran, the giant king of the Britons, was buried under the Gwynfryn, the White Hill in Kaerlud. I know that place. It’s in London now, less that an hour’s walk from where I live. The head lies across the road from a Tesco and a chain ramen restaurant and the Four Seasons Hotel. Buried, but not so deep.</p>

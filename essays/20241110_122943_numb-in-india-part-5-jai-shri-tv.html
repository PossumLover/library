I’m accused of having something to do with the murder of Baba Siddique, a politician I’d never even heard of until I came here. I don’t even know if Baba was his name or a nickname or a title or what, but last month Baba Siddique was gunned down by three contract killers outside his office, and now I’m here. </p><p>If nothing terrible happens before the next instalment, I’ll explain how I ended up in this position. In fact, before I was arrested I’d written a fair amount about Mumbai, featuring several brilliant insights. (Did you know that this city is very large? And that its people include both the extremely rich and the extremely poor?) It’ll have to wait. In the meantime, last weekend was Diwali, India’s biggest festival. Outside, I’m sure, there were diyas flickering on every windowsill, the whole endless metropolis glowing with a warm and welcoming light: from the glass windows of the skyscrapers, from the reeking holes in the slums. I’m sure the sky was bright with fireworks. I’m sure everyone danced in the streets. But where I am, the only light comes from a single fluorescent tube, and it’s been buzzing with its stark grey pallor ever since they threw me in here. No candles or dancing in my windowless cell, but I still get to hear the firecrackers. For maybe one hundred hours over the Diwali weekend there were constant firecrackers, maybe one every three seconds. As far as I can tell—although I can’t tell much from in here—people are setting off these things entirely at random. While waiting for the bus, strolling out of a restaurant, in the middle of the day, sitting in the park, fielding in a cricket game—chuck a firecracker: bang. The sound is muffled through the concrete but I can still hear every single one of them. Like gunshots. Apparently, when Baba Siddique was assassinated, he was idly throwing firecrackers on the street. The shots that killed him melted into the general din. You could hide an entire war in this city and nobody would know.</p><p>Everyone knows that Diwali is about celebrating the victory of good over evil and light over darkness. As meanings go, this is not very impressive. (A religion that upholds good over evil? Does your culture also value food and hospitality?) But if it sounds generic, that’s because it is. Officially, Diwali doesn’t actually commemorate anything in particular. In the south of India, it celebrates the time Krishna defeated the demon Narakasura. In Bengal, it celebrates the time Kali defeated the demon Raktabija. India, famously, has a lot of gods. But if you spend any amount of time here, it becomes clear that these days there’s only one, and the other gods have become a kind of supporting cast around him. Outside a few scattered minor cults, the god of India is Lord Ram. I’ve been to any number of Hindu temples notionally dedicated to Lakshmi or Ganesh, with a female or elephant-headed shape in the garbhagriha, but through the loudspeakers dotted around the place disembodied voices continually chant <em>Jai Shri Ram</em>. That same phrase has become a Hindu nationalist rallying cry; it’s what the mobs shout when they burn Muslim neighbourhoods. And for the majority of this country, Diwali is about Ram too: it celebrates his return to the kingdom of Ayodhya after his fourteen years of exile, in which he defeated the demon Ravana. (Defeating demons is a big deal here.) The story of Ram is deeply ingrained in this country: most people will never read the <em>Ramayana</em>, and a lot of Hindus have a very vague sense of their own religion, but this particular narrative is the scaffolding that supports the world. Ram, the hero, the perfect man. Sita, the perfect bride. Ravana, who contains every evil. Outsiders can try to study Hinduism through its vast archive of holy texts, the hoary chants of the Vedas, the philosophical Upanishads, the weird and brilliant stories of the Puranas, or maybe through yoga, meditation, spiritual communion—but the real core of it is that everyone knows the story of Ram and Sita before they can walk. This narrative is in the blood, like microplastics. Which is a shame, because once you strip away the poetry of the ancient text, the story of Ram is a very insipid fairytale.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>This is the gist of it: imagine a guy who’s the best at everything. He’s the most handsome, everyone loves him, and he kills ten trillion demons with every shot from his bow. In fact, there’s never an enemy he can’t instantly overpower by being the best at everything. Even the demons are constantly singing his praises, and even when he does things that seem morally iffy, like intervening in a spat between brothers by hiding in the forest and murdering one of them from a distance, in the end he’s so epochally self-righteous that the person he’s just mortally wounded has to accept that his killing is actually wonderful and good. I could maybe get into this if it were just a piece of martial literature, if Ram were a knightly hero like Arthur or Roland, but here this basically vacuous account of good and evil is raised to the level of religion. In the end, it’s revealed that Ram is the god Vishnu in human form, the infinite Mind that pervades the universe, the principle of ultimate reality itself. Then he exiles his pregnant wife into the wilderness because he heard someone gossiping about her at the laundrette. In the entire narrative, King Ram does precisely one thing that sort-of counts as governing his realm, and it’s the summary execution of a peasant who tried to perform the ascetic practices of his betters. Some of the digressions are, admittedly, a lot of fun to read.</p><p>If Ram is the presiding deity of modern India, it’s because he echoes a particular wound in this country. Those fourteen years of exile: a thousand years of conquest and domination, temples razed for mosques, the indignity of European rule. But to give him his due, at least Ram accepted his exile with equanimity, and returned to his kingdom without resentment. His heirs—not so much. This year, in Ayodhya, Diwali was marked with a Guinness World Record-beating display of two and a half million oil lamps, plus a genuinely deranged speech from Yogi Adityanath, the mad Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, who warned that dark forces were trying to divide India, that these forces ‘carry the DNA of Ravana,’ that they want to return India to ‘anarchy’ and ‘hooliganism,’ and that if he got his hands on any of these people, ‘it will lead to Ram naam satya,’ which means ‘the name of Ram is truth,’ and is what Hindu mourners chant when they’re carrying a body to be burned. I try to imagine Charles saying this sort of thing in his next Christmas broadcast; it doesn’t quite gel. But Adityanath has a habit of saying sweeping, menacing things, like ‘Those who do not belong to Ram are of no use to us,’ or ‘Those who do politics in the name of secularism would cripple the spirit of the nation,’ or ‘Those who put obstacles in the way of Hindu dharma will meet the same fate as any other gangsters.’ I’ll admit to being fascinated by the guy; I think it’s because, in a way, I know him. Look at a picture of the man, imagine him without his saffron monk’s robes: he looks like an Israeli. The thick features and thuggish eyes of someone called Dvor Galod, Member of the Knesset from the Gas the Arabs Party. But India is weirder than Israel. Yogi Adityanath spent an undisclosed fortune in state funds compiling an International Encyclopaedia of the Ramayana, which documents how people have worshipped Ram around the world for over five thousand years, including in ancient Europe and Central America. He’s very popular.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0821793-b119-4c56-bc75-96b3285fd686_3514x2635.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0821793-b119-4c56-bc75-96b3285fd686_3514x2635.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0821793-b119-4c56-bc75-96b3285fd686_3514x2635.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0821793-b119-4c56-bc75-96b3285fd686_3514x2635.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0821793-b119-4c56-bc75-96b3285fd686_3514x2635.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0821793-b119-4c56-bc75-96b3285fd686_3514x2635.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a0821793-b119-4c56-bc75-96b3285fd686_3514x2635.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2795597,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0821793-b119-4c56-bc75-96b3285fd686_3514x2635.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0821793-b119-4c56-bc75-96b3285fd686_3514x2635.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0821793-b119-4c56-bc75-96b3285fd686_3514x2635.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0821793-b119-4c56-bc75-96b3285fd686_3514x2635.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>There was something about the cult of Ram that kept bugging me, that felt eerily familiar, until I finally worked out what it is. It’s <em>fan culture</em>. People here chant <em>Jai Shri Ram</em> and dangle idols of him from their rear-view mirrors for the same reason that people in the West wear football shirts or cover their homes in <em>Star Wars</em> crap: they’re fans, they’re on team Ram. Ram is like Superman, if people actually worshipped him as a god. He’s like Jesus Christ, a mortal man who is also a transcendent deity, but a lot <em>more</em> like Jesus Christ and Harry Potter and Mickey Mouse all rolled into one. The <em>Ramayana</em> is a literary epic and a religious text, but it’s also a media franchise. There’s something for everyone here: a soppy love story with epic fight sequences, and if you really squeeze you can wring some mystical import out of it too. Like most modern media franchises a lot of it is based in comic books, the Amar Chitra Katha comics that introduced three generations of Indian children to a bright, streamlined version of their culture. It has movies, like last year’s Telugu epic <em>Adipurush</em>, the third highest-budget production in Indian history, which I watched shortly before I came out here: three hours of incredibly janky CGI monkeys fighting incredibly janky CGI troll-things. It has TV shows, like <em>Ramayan</em>, which might be the most-watched entertainment programme in human history. During its initial run in 1987 the entire country shut down whenever <em>Ramayan</em> was on. Streets empty, shops shuttered, buses immobile, trains cancelled. In rural areas an entire village would crowd around a single TV set hooked up to a car battery. If Pakistan had attacked during a broadcast their troops would have been in Delhi by the time the credits rolled. Something like eighty percent of the entire population of India watched it, and when the show ended street cleaners across the country went on strike, demanding that the government fund more episodes. (They did.) You can <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFPJRCFRDARSZofcQcV6m7Pu2EAL8_1dv&amp;si=7zUdYic-VbYguqUN">watch the whole show</a> on YouTube, and while the fight sequences are full of wobbly greenscreen effects, and up to sixty percent of each episode can consist of various arrows flying at each other, and Hanuman has big wax monkey lips, there’s a genuine dignity to the thing. It holds up, better than <em>Adipurush</em>. When it was rebroadcast during the pandemic, hundreds of millions of people tuned in all over again. This year Arun Govil, the actor who plays Ram, was elected to Parliament for the BJP. But as well as comic books and movies and TV shows, this media franchise also includes the stories you were told on your grandmother’s knee. In India, religion and the culture industry are the same thing.</p><p>This might not seem all that unique. Hollywood used to make Biblical epics, and a lot of people used to watch those too. A lot of people watched <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>. Churches bussed their congregations into the cinemas. The difference is that nobody actually fell to their knees in front of the screen and started worshipping Jim Caviezel’s fake-blood-splattered Jesus: this was a culture-commodity that <em>referred</em> to the content of the religion. In Hinduism, that distinction is not so clear. During <em>Ramayan</em>’s initial run, people would take ritual baths before watching the show, garland the television with strings of flowers, light puja lamps and perform aarti in front of the screen. And why not? This is what you do with the black staring idol of the god in the innermost womb of the temple, or with the framed picture in your own little shrine at home. The god resides in his image, and a TV show is an image. Traditionally, a murti or idol is imbued with divine life through the ritual of prana pratishtha, in which worshippers chant ten million mantras before the statue. How many mantras do you think people chanted in front of the image of Arun Govil in a big plastic hat? Tune your TV to the right channel and it becomes the dwelling-place of a god. One immaterial temple, liquid on the airwaves, swallowing media conglomerates, bouncing off satellites in outer space…</p><p>Or maybe the glowing sanctum in every mandir was just an early form of TV, waiting for the technology to catch up. Western commodity-culture is, as everyone got bored of pointing out by the mid-70s, a visual, spectacular culture, all floating images in the void. But McLuhan tries to contrast the ‘rational, visual European pattern of experience’ with ‘the total inclusive field of resonance that is India.’ McLuhan is like a tourist, dazzled by all the smokes and smells in the spice market. He doesn’t get it. India is even <em>more</em> visual than Europe; it preceded us down the road of hypermodern spectacle. (The new emerging digital animism might end up feeling a little subcontinental. Already, half the digital economy involves performing strange and undignified rites in the hope that some algorithm will see you. Put your big smiling face on the YouTube thumbnail; the nameless power likes that. Already Uber drivers are praying to their phones in the hope that it’ll turn on surge pricing. You are not ready for the cyberhinduism that’s coming.) When a Hindu goes to temple, they don’t say they’re going to pray, they say they’re going for darshan. Darshan means vision, the ecstatic vision of the god made sensuous. But it’s a double movement, darshan dena and darshan lena: giving and receiving sight. You look at the god, the god looks at you. Supposedly you can tell the avatar of a god when he walks the earth in human form because an avatar never blinks. Some of the simplest idols I’ve seen here, crammed into street-corner shrines, have been orange discs, or black lumps of charcoal, or even corn husks, all strewn with flowers, blank except a pair of unsettling eyes. </p><p>Unsettling, because I’ve inherited two and a half millennia of propaganda against exactly this kind of thing. The foundational act of Judaism is Abraham smashing his father’s idols, and I think it’s this Abrahamic heritage that kept the Euro-Mediterranean world out of pure modern visuality until the rise of electronic media. Instead of the image, we have the Word. Not all the time, obviously. There’s a panel in the Sistine Chapel in which Michelangelo shows God from behind, with God’s pink robes tight around his body, damply disclosing the two meaty globes of God’s arse, with God’s arsecrack yawning mightily between them, and there’s a remnant of my education in aniconism at North West London Jewish Day School that’s genuinely shocked that something so obviously idolatrous is not just in a church, but one of the holiest churches on the planet. And that same remnant has been vibrating in outrage basically ever since I got off the plane in Delhi, only briefly quieting down when I’m in the safely abstract confines of a mosque or a gurdwara, because <em>these people worship idols</em>. I find it hard not to sympathise with the first Muslim conquerors who came to find people worshipping monkeys and elephants: their prim horror of the image. (My girlfriend, who is a fairly High Church type of Anglican, is much more comfortable with it.) But because I’m a guest in this beautiful country, even if it’s currently locked me up in one of its jail cells, I still feel a bit sheepish about putting that horror into words. India is still distant from me; I’ll never write as well or as viciously about it as VS Naipaul. </p><p>Naipaul wasn’t an Indian either, but his great-grandparents had come to Trinidad from the Gangetic plain, and his childhood was filled with small rituals and fragments of India, ‘like trapdoors into a bottomless past.’ The wrongness in India is personal for him, in the same way that the wrongness in Israel is personal for me. He diagnoses the entire country with a ‘defect of vision’ produced by the stifling, cloistered closeness of caste and village life. ‘Among Indians there seems to be a different relationship to outside reality, compared with the West. In India it is closer to a certain stage in childhood when outer objects did not have a separate, independent existence but were intimately related to the self and its affective states. They were not something in their own right, but were good or bad, threatening or rewarding, helpful or cruel, all depending on the person’s feelings of the moment.’ The double edge of darshan, the mute object that watches you with the intense emotive power of a god. Naipaul’s account of his travels here was banned in India for its ‘negative portrayal’ of the country and its people. That was in 1964. The ban is still in place.</p><p>Still, behind the Indian structure of seeing, there’s the unseeable. In fact, Judaism and Hinduism both start with the same broad assumption: there is a God beyond all possible human perception, which cannot possibly be captured in any visual image. In both traditions, the power of God resides in a <em>spoken word</em>: the name of YHVH, the universal Brahman-syllable Aum. The difference is that in Judaism, anyone who speaks the name of God is condemned to death, and any visual representation of God—or anything else for that matter—is deadly too. Hinduism has less of a neurosis about this stuff. Since God partakes of everything, <em>any</em> image can potentially capture a part of his being, and serve as an entry into the contemplation of the divine. Ram is God’s justice, Krishna is God’s playfulness. Images of the gods are sacred because <em>the gods themselves are images</em>, representations of what cannot be seen. The Sanskrit word is deva: shining thing. The hypnotic glow of a screen.</p><p>This is why Hindu deities are nested in such a complicated array of aspects and manifestations and avatars and forms. I thought about writing a big grand parody of this, inventing various wacky gods to be reflections of each other, but I can’t compete with the real thing. Take the goddess Durga, who is the fearsome aspect of the goddess Parvati, who is herself an expression of the goddess Shakti. Durga has various manifestations of her own, which sometimes, confusingly, include Parvati. One of them is Kushmanda, Nurturer of the Cosmic Egg. After one of the cyclical destructions of the universe, Kushmanda reignited the light of creation with a single smile. Another aspect of Durga is Kali, naked, black-skinned, red-eyed, her ten arms brandishing weapons and severed heads, her tongue lolling out above her razor-sharp fangs, consumer of lives, slayer of the gods, the void that remains. According to some Tantric sects, Kali is not just one form among others but the Ultimate Reality itself, the true form of God. And everything that exists is eventually destroyed; the infinite feasts on all briefer forms: maybe they’re right. </p><p>Or look at Vishnu. Ram is an avatar of Vishnu; so is Krishna. But in the <em>Adhyatma</em> <em>Ramayana</em>, the entire physical universe is an expression of Ram. In the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, Krishna the friendly charioteer reveals himself as the Universal Mind, the self that resides inside each creature, with infinite arms and heads and ‘mouths dancing with tusks, like the flames of universal dissolution,’ consuming heroes and worlds. Depending on who you believe, Vishnu is actually just a minor form of Krishna or Ram. </p><p>There have been plenty of attempts to make it all make sense, to sweep away the ten thousand mutually contradictory hierarchies, pick one god to represent the ultimate reality, and demote all the other deities into his various aspects. The result is that now there are ten thousand and one mutually contradictory hierarchies. It’s never going to make sense: coherence is not the point; the point is that all these gods are just the modes of appearance of something else. In the end, it all comes down to taste. Particular types of people will gravitate to particular expressions of the divinity. Pick an image, an avatar, a two-thousand-year-old media franchise, and follow it.

If the distinction between devas is fundamentally aesthetic, then there’s no reason why I—as an occasional, jobbing arts critic—shouldn’t branch out into being a reviewer of gods.</p><p>You already know what I think of Ram. To be honest, most of the Vishnu Cinematic Universe doesn’t really do it for me. It’s all a bit too simple, goodies-versus-baddies. Crowd-pleasing, sure, but where’s the depth? Krishna has some potential, this libidinous herdsman, a dark and sexually voracious god, but the only version of Krishna I’ve actually seen portrayed here is Krishna as a blue butter-eating baby, all big eyes and chubby cheeks. Every single corner shop in this country is called Krishna Stores, and every single one of them has an AI-generated image of the newborn god up in the window. Nauseatingly saccharine. The theological equivalent of a <em>live, laugh, love</em> poster. Not for me. Those are the two big blockbuster avatars, but actually, I do like some of Vishnu’s early incarnations, before he got famous. The first four avatars were all cosmic animals: a fish, a tortoise, a pig, a lion. I like the fifth too, in which Vishnu came to earth as Vamana the dwarf. Vamana is a shy, sober, quiet little man who’s notable only for his devotion in always performing the ritual sacrifices. His piety is so great that the demon Mahabali, who’s defeated the gods and seized control of the universe, offers him a gift. The dwarf asks for only as much land as he can cover in three steps, and Mahabali agrees. The dwarf stretches out his leg, and in one step he encompasses the entire physical universe. His second step stretches across the heavens. I have taken two steps, Vishnu thunders, and now there is nowhere left to go: where else can I place my foot? The demon Mahabali, acknowledging defeat, prostrates himself, and Vishnu puts his third step on the demon’s head, crushing it.</p><p>My favourite form of Vishnu, though, is Narayana. As Narayana, Vishnu lies asleep in the chasms of the primordial ocean, resting on the belly of Anantashesha, a seven-headed serpent who supports all seven worlds on his heads, and each physical universe feels no heavier than a mustard seed. Narayana dreams time and space into being, but he does not know he is asleep and he does not know he is dreaming. A lotus flower grows from his navel. Sometimes the gods crowd around his bed and beg him for help: another demon-king has emerged, performed great austerities, and now no one can defeat him; they need the mighty power of Vishnu. But Narayana lies dreaming: he’s dreaming being you.</p><p>But to be honest, the god I really like most is Shiva.</p><p>Shiva is a difficult figure. Whenever demons gain terrible powers and Vishnu has to incarnate on Earth to sort it out, it’s usually because they’ve been meditating and offering prayers to Shiva. This is a wild man, a savage, wandering the mountains. A half-mad ascetic. He wears a string of human skulls around his neck. His face is grey with ashes. His hair is matted. Dreadlocks and grime. When the river Ganges first entered the world, its flow was so powerful it threatened to obliterate the universe, until Shiva, in his Himalayan haunt, let it pass through his matted hair. He is not a reputable figure. Sati, the daughter of King Daksha fell in love with this hermit-god, but Daksha didn’t think Shiva deserved his daughter. He didn’t like the thought of her cavorting with this morbid loner. Eventually he insulted Shiva so much in Sati’s presence that she threw herself on a sacrificial pyre, died, and gave her name to the practice of widow-burning. Sati was reborn as the goddess Parvati, Shiva’s wife, and they had something like a happy ending. There are a lot of images of them with their children, looking like the Holy Family. Shiva as a clean-cut, respectable paterfamilias, living decently in the healthy white hills. Parvati, the modest housewife. Still, there’s always an undercurrent of sexuality and violence; the weirdness doesn’t scrub out. The little baby Shiva and Parvati dote has the head of an elephant: why is that? According to the <em>Shiva Purana</em>, Ganesh was a boy that Parvati made out of turmeric paste to guard her modesty while she was bathing. When Shiva came along to fuck his wife, Ganesh stopped him. Shiva tried explaining that he was Parvati’s husband, but Ganesh still wouldn’t let him pass; finally, in a rage, Shiva cut off his head. This upset Parvati so much she threatened to destroy the universe entirely, but Shiva promised to bring the head of the first creature he saw and bring Ganesh back to life. The first thing he saw was an elephant. Somewhere out of sight, behind the smiling icons of Shiva and his family, there’s the headless body of an elephant pouring torrents of blood into the soil.</p><p>Unlike most deities, Shiva is always represented in abstraction. Sort of. There are enormous Shiva statues dotted around the country, humanoid and smiling, but in the temples, in the garbhagrihas, the soot-black chambers at the centre of everything where the god resides, Shiva is only an austere lingam, or sign: an unadorned black stone column raised on a round disc. The column is Shiva’s penis.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> The disc is Parvati’s cunt.</p><p>On the island of Elephanta in Mumbai Harbour, just a few kilometres out from the enormous cranes of the huge container port, there’s a cave where Shiva lives. To get there, you have to sit in a hot boat for an hour and a half as it splutters over the water. On the day I went, Mumbai was deep in a haze. Car exhaust and factory smoke and fogs off the Arabian Sea. The entire sky glowed white, like a huge diffuse sun; the white listless sea glowed like the sky; all objects dissolved into its blankness. After ten minutes the Gateway of India and the red dome of the Taj Mahal Palace had been bleached into nothing. The ten thousand skyscrapers of Mumbai were a series of faint, ghostly notches hovering above the stillness of the white waters. Every so often a container ship would loom out of the brightness, this vast body of rusting iron, seawater streaming down its flanks, not quite solid: the ghost of a ship, stranded halfway across Lethe. Finally you arrive on this antill of an island, surrounded on all sides by stinking mangrove mudflats, and in the heat and the whiteness of the day, you climb. </p><p>Fifteen hundred years ago, someone cut a cave into this rock. The entrance is lined with huge columns carved out of the stone; there are temples in there in the moss and the gloom, with ancient stairs leading up to the sanctum; and right at the back the walls are carved with Shiva. An immense three-headed bust of Shiva, twenty-three feet tall, billowing out of the rock. I stood there for a while, staring into his enormous face. I think I had something like a spiritual experience, encountering this god of the gloomy places, in his dark retreat beneath the surface of the earth. Maybe a spiritual experience is when there’s a big head, and the bigger the head, the more spiritual the experience. For a moment it felt much larger than it was. The clammy shadows in the cave melt into the clammy shadows in outer space, and Shiva towers over the universe, his long matted hair trailing down until it becomes the filaments of galaxies and the voids in between. But that’s only vastness; Vishnu stuff. The really important statue is the figure to the left. Shiva in his form as Ardhanarishvara, the hermaphrodite, half-female, with a single breast, dancing with his arms open against the chaos of the forms of the world. Shiva has brought you here, to this wet hole, to induct you into the secret of the world. Something that can’t be seen in the sunlight where Vishnu plays. It has something to do with sexual difference, but here in the darkness things are not so clear-cut. The visible barely rises out of the invisible. Male and female are mixed, indistinguishable; creator and created, real and unreal…</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb787206-0f0a-4a28-ba8a-9095ef1d9ff0_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb787206-0f0a-4a28-ba8a-9095ef1d9ff0_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb787206-0f0a-4a28-ba8a-9095ef1d9ff0_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb787206-0f0a-4a28-ba8a-9095ef1d9ff0_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb787206-0f0a-4a28-ba8a-9095ef1d9ff0_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb787206-0f0a-4a28-ba8a-9095ef1d9ff0_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/db787206-0f0a-4a28-ba8a-9095ef1d9ff0_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2080732,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb787206-0f0a-4a28-ba8a-9095ef1d9ff0_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb787206-0f0a-4a28-ba8a-9095ef1d9ff0_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb787206-0f0a-4a28-ba8a-9095ef1d9ff0_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb787206-0f0a-4a28-ba8a-9095ef1d9ff0_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I got the boat back to Mumbai.

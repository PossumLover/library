He’d keep on building it for the rest of his life. The machine was a notebook, a huge compendium of thoughts and quotes and memories, big and dense enough to reaches a kind of critical mass where it can accurately simulate a human life. He called it ‘a weapon in my heart that will conquer death.’ For the machine to work, though, it needed everything. ‘I need to retrieve every word she ever said,’ he wrote. ‘I need to walk in her steps and smell the flowers she smelled, the greatgrandchild of every blossom that she held up to her powerful nostrils. I need to piece back together the mirrors that once reflected her image. I want to know every syllable she could have possibly said in any language.’ I know that feeling. After my best friend died six years ago, <a href="https://samkriss.com/2018/11/08/there-she-goes/">I said something very similar</a>. ‘Somewhere, everything that happened must be written down for eternity. There has to be a recording angel, there has to be a Book of Life, so that what has been doesn’t simply pass away. I felt the desperate urge to write it all. How once, in Prague, her shoes started falling apart and her feet started stinking, and she fixed it by stopping at a park bench to smear her toes in toothpaste. All this needed to be indexed, every living detail.’ Human life needs to be copied over into a medium less fragile than itself. In the same notebook, decades later, Canetti wrote about the ‘enormous stock of memories and habits, deferred questions, frozen answers, thoughts, emotions, tender feelings’ that we build up over the course of a life. How absurd for it all to just vanish when we die. ‘The disproportionate size of this pile—and all of it for nothing?’ He would preserve his pile. He would live in his pile when he was finished living in his body. Thousands of pages. He called it <em>The Book Against Death</em>.</p><p>But that year, the year he really started working in earnest on his immortality device, the year he decided to ‘record thoughts against death as they happen to occur to me, without any kind of structure and without submitting them to any tyrannical plan,’ was 1942. While he was trying to drag his mother backwards out of her grave, a lot of people were busy dying. Millions of nice, bookish European Jews like Elias Canetti and his mother were being exterminated. In Leningrad they were eating grass and bark and eventually each other. In Singapore the Japanese occupation was rounding up Chinese men, driving them outside the city, and executing them in batches. Death had lost its individual, handmade charm; across the world, it was being mass-produced, uniform and identical for every customer. It was happening on the population level now. And Canetti does write about the war, the bombers ‘shimmering in the sun like flowers, like fish, after they have levelled entire cities.’ But not as much as he writes about his mother. Doesn't it feel a bit like cruelty, to care so much about one person when there are so many others being violently exterminated, all around you, right now? Even if it is your family?</p><div><hr></div><p>I say all this because I’m writing from Tel Aviv. I’m here for a funeral. Jewish funerals happen quick: the point is to overwhelm you with practicalities, small chores and details, so you hardly have any time to wallow in your grief. It’s a very practical religion. I got the bad news on Tuesday morning; that afternoon I was already on an El Al flight from London Luton to Ben Gurion, wedged into my seat by the black-hatted frummer next to me. The frummer billowed magnificently over the armrest. The outer extremities of the frummer were constantly wobbling and roiling as he squinted at the comically tiny Hebrew letters in his comically tiny little book. Not a siddur: some special, advanced prayer book known only to to the blackest-hatted of frummers. When the stewardess arrived with his special kosher meal he studied the hechsher with similar intensity and then refused to touch it. Not kosher enough. On my other side was a blonde girl with immaculately painted nails and a sparkly scrunchie around her wrist. She’d overheard me back at the airport, ranting about Israelis. The gate had been full of Israelis, big crude meaty Israelis with big crude Israeli faces, barging in front of each other, talking too loud, clinking their carrier bags full of duty-free whisky. There were several reasons I wasn’t feeling great, and it all came out down the phone. I thought I was speaking—muttering, really—in a quiet, unobtrusive voice. ‘Never mind the politics,’ I said, ‘forget the war, the atrocities, whatever, these are just <em>not good people</em>. They are <em>nasty people</em>. Rude, pushy, bossy, petty, ugly people. Look at the way they drive. You can extrapolate the entire history of Israel from their behaviour on the road. They just do not care about anyone else. Fuck you, out of my way. <em>Ma ichpat li</em>, why should I care: that's their national motto. They’ve managed to combine all the negative traits of Jews and Arabs, with none of the positives. Jews without intellect. Arabs without hospitality. And those horrible fucking space alien names they all have. Gorev Eshlit. Dvor Magog. What sort of name is that for a Jew?’ </p><p>And so on. I might have thought I was being quiet, but I was born here; I guess I’m also a loud, rude, tactless Israeli. So about half an hour into the flight, the blonde girl suddenly turned to me and asked if I was a reporter. I’ve done some stuff that might plausibly count as reporting, but since I wasn’t really sure where this was going I said no. ‘Oh,’ she said, ‘I just thought you might be because I heard you talking in the airport, and I didn't understand why you're going to Israel if you hate Israel so much.’ That was a little mortifying. ‘Sometimes I get carried away,’ I said, ‘I don’t always mean everything I say.’ But she still wanted to know why I was going to Israel if I wasn’t a reporter, so I told her. Now she looked mortified. ‘I’m sorry,’ she said. ‘It’s ok,’ I said. I asked why she was going. She said her cousin had been shot. ‘In Gaza?’ I said. ‘Yeah,’ she said, ‘in Gaza.’ He was in a military hospital. ‘I’m sorry,’ I said. ‘It’s ok,’ she said.</p><p>My uncle wasn’t shot in Gaza. He died in hospital after two consecutive heart attacks while being treated for stomach cancer. When Dave was first diagnosed with the cancer, the outlook wasn’t good. Stage four. Maybe six months to a year. That was eight years ago. He was there at his eldest son’s wedding. He wrote. He <a href="https://soundcloud.com/david-kriss-1/">made music</a>. Eight years in the sunshine: he was very lucky. If you can call it luck.</p><p>Still, it felt bad, coming here, and not just because of all the ordinary reasons, grief and loss. A funeral is one thing—but while I’m here I also have to eat, and the afternoons are hot, and you can’t just sit grieving all day, so coming here also means walking along the seafront, and reading a book in the shade, and maybe taking a nice swim in the warm waters of the Mediterranean. Meanwhile, thirty-five miles away in Gaza, just down the coast, this same country is subjecting millions of people to famine, torture, and death. Down there, fathers cradle the headless corpses of their children. Skin melted off human bodies. Mass graves under the hospitals. What’s happening there is very plausibly a genocide, and it's happening about as far from the nice beaches and shady streets of Tel Aviv as Luton Airport is from my home in London. There’s a very persuasive argument that I simply should not have come here. Call it <em>moral hygiene.</em> My being in Israel might not change anything either way, but I still have a duty not to sunbathe outside the charnel house. If you have any respect at all for the people of Gaza, you should not spend any amount of time in this creepy <em>Zone of Interest</em>-style ethical nightmare, where sunflowers grow in orderly lines just outside the scene of what might be the worst crime of the twenty-first century. I knew all of this. It didn’t make me pause for even an instant. As soon as I heard the news, I knew I had to go. Maybe it’s wrong, maybe it’s indefensible; it doesn’t matter. My father had lost his only brother. This was my family.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>My flight landed at about three in the morning. As we taxied to the gate, the pilot gave his usual goodbye. ‘We thank you for flying with El Al,’ he said, ‘we wish for the swift return of the hostages, and we hope you have a good night.’ At Ben Gurion Airport, the little display on each of the automated passport barriers showed a picture of one of the hostages as a kind of screensaver, with the words ‘Bring Him Home NOW!’ The hostages are inescapable. Across Tel Aviv, graffiti on the streets in Hebrew and English says <em>bring them home</em>. Banners on municipal buildings say <em>bring them home</em>. Posters tacked to walls. I walked past a place called Cicchetti on Yeduha HaLevi Street, which explained its name in English on the wall. ‘Not exactly a restaurant, nor a wine bar, but a unique kind of place.’ People were drinking aperol spritzes on the pavement. Eating small plates. It seemed nice. It had the words ‘BRING THEM HOME’ frosted into the glass of the windows. Other places are more sinister. There's an old Bauhaus cinema in Neve Tzedek that's been boarded up for years; last time I was here some local street artist had decorated it with paintings of creepy, doll-like girls. The girls are still there, but now each one of them has a caption. ‘KILLED BY ARABS.’ ‘RAPED BY ARABS.’ ‘KIDNAPPED BY ARABS.’</p><p>Opposite the Tel Aviv Museum of Art there’s an entire square devoted to the hostages. Installations by local artists. One of them set up a long table with a place set for every person taken into Gaza. Empty plates. Vases of dead flowers. The whole thing covered in deathly grey, the grey of a bombed-out city. Another artist built a replica of the Hamas tunnels: you crouch in the dark while hidden speakers play the sounds of gunfire. There was a big hourglass filled with red sand and topped with the words ‘HOSTAGES are still there.’ An explanatory note in ESL Artspeak. ‘The hourglass as a symbol and manifestation seeks a place in our new everyday life adapting to emergency routine. The clash between this symbol and the routine that comes with the ongoing war creates tension and curiosity and evokes different emotions among the passers-by.’ All the red sand had long since fallen through.</p><p>I couldn't help finding it obscene, the cult of the hostages. There are two million ordinary people in Gaza, living in fear under the drones and the bombs, torn away from their homes, waking up every day without knowing if they’ll live to see the next. Of those two million, eighty are Israeli hostages. They have my sympathy. It must be horrible. But what about the rest? Israelis, even nice liberals in Tel Aviv, don’t seem to care. Suffering in Gaza is not in the news. People don’t talk about it. Everything that might trouble the conscience gets drowned out by a constant thrum, the hostages the hostages the hostages, bring them home bring them home bring them home. Do they really think an Israeli is worth that much more than a Palestinian? Pointless question. I already know the answer. Look, they’d reply, the hostages are part of our country. They speak our language. They follow our religion. We’re the same. No, the life of an Israeli isn’t <em>inherently</em> more valuable than the life of a Palestinian, but <em>of course</em> we care more about the Israelis. This is our family.</p><p>What makes things thornier is that in Israel, caring about the people of Gaza is, in some cases, literally illegal. This is not a country with a robust commitment to free speech. Israelis who try to speak out against the mass murder are hounded out of public life. Mobs descend on middle-aged teachers who post generic appeals for peace on their Facebook pages. When an ultra-Orthodox journalist filmed himself saying kaddish for the dead in Gaza, they lobbed fireworks at his house. (That’s the Jews; when Palestinian citizens of Israel—who have never, whatever people like to say, enjoyed equal rights—do the same, they’re arrested under anti-terror legislation.) There have been some peace marches in Tel Aviv. No one waves the Palestinian flag: it’s illegal. No one says <em>from the river to the sea</em>. Exactly the kind of Palestine solidarity march a lot of hysterics seem to wish we could have in the West: conducted under conditions of terror, without any solidarity for Palestine.</p><p>But in this environment, the slogan <em>bring them home</em> <em>now</em> is capable of being very lightly subversive. The authorities are uneasy about it. I walked to the Kirya, the IDF’s headquarters in Tel Aviv. It’s a big glassy office building off the Ayalon Highway; as even its Wikipedia article notes, the IDF has embedded this military target in a dense urban environment surrounded by civilian infrastructue. Around the Kirya, there were a lot of posters ripped down and a lot of graffiti painted over. Not by antizionists. When it’s in a banner on a public building, <em>bring them home</em> means <em>unite behind the military</em>. But if they’re spraypainted on the same building, those words might mean <em>stop the war</em>. Everyone knows that Israel’s massacre in Gaza has killed more Israeli hostages than it’s rescued. Everyone knows that the only way to actually bring the hostages home is by negotiating a deal with Hamas. This is why the Israeli right-wing declared, immediately after the attacks on October 7th, that the hostages were already as good as dead, and the IDF should level Gaza as if they weren’t there. There’s a large section of Israeli society that thinks the families of the hostages are all basically traitors, terrorist sympathisers, almost as bad as Hamas. The parents of the hostages don’t want infinite death and destruction in Gaza, they just want to see their children again. How selfish of them: to care so little about the state of Israel, its security, its deterrence, and so much about their own little families.</p><div><hr></div><p>It’s political, who you choose to care about. Maybe it’s the root of all politics. In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12227-0">2019 study</a> in <em>Nature</em>, Waytz et al found that people with different political ideologies have dramatically different ‘moral circles.’ One hundred and thirty-one subjects were presented with a diagram showing a series of concentric circles to represent the moral universe. The innermost circle stood for your immediate family, the next was extended family, then close friends. The outermost circles represented ‘all natural things in the universe including inert entities such as rocks,’ and, finally, ‘all things in existence.’ (Not included: things that no longer exist, the vanished, the dead. Weird omission. We can also have a duty to them. They can also be wronged.) The subjects were asked to put a sticker at the point that they thought marked the limits of their concern. The differences were stark. People on the right cared about their family and friends only; a few extended it as far as their fellow-citizens, but everyone else could die in a ditch for all they cared. Not their business. People on the left, meanwhile, said that they felt a profound ethical responsibility to ensure the wellbeing of every amoeba and paramecium on the planet, along with hypothetical aliens from outer space. Quite a few of them also included the rocks.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fb1ee50-5b65-4945-820a-6aad73bf9f01_2005x843.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fb1ee50-5b65-4945-820a-6aad73bf9f01_2005x843.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fb1ee50-5b65-4945-820a-6aad73bf9f01_2005x843.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fb1ee50-5b65-4945-820a-6aad73bf9f01_2005x843.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fb1ee50-5b65-4945-820a-6aad73bf9f01_2005x843.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fb1ee50-5b65-4945-820a-6aad73bf9f01_2005x843.webp" width="1456" height="612" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4fb1ee50-5b65-4945-820a-6aad73bf9f01_2005x843.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:612,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:83892,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fb1ee50-5b65-4945-820a-6aad73bf9f01_2005x843.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fb1ee50-5b65-4945-820a-6aad73bf9f01_2005x843.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fb1ee50-5b65-4945-820a-6aad73bf9f01_2005x843.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fb1ee50-5b65-4945-820a-6aad73bf9f01_2005x843.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This is a very dumb thing to think, which might be why there’s been a resurgence in the conservative position: that you should care about the people close to you, and not bother yourself too much with anyone else. People on the left, they note, tend to use distant causes as a way of laundering their consciences. You might be a vicious, spiteful little toad, you might have cut off your entire family because you’ve decided they're toxic, you might pursue low-intensity vendettas against every single one of your friends, you might find it impossible to fuck someone without actively trying to destroy them afterwards—but you're still a <em>good person</em>, because you care about Gaza. Like Mrs Jellyby in <em>Bleak House</em>, who ‘devotes herself entirely to the public,’ fretting about the natives of Borrioboola-Gha while her own children live in filth. Have you done anything meaningful to <em>help</em> Gaza? No. But it’s in your moral circle. You care. (Although trying to help might not be too great either. Sam Bankman-Fried made himself a billionaire by straightforwardly stealing other people's money, but he also spent a good chunk of that money on mosquito nets for people in Africa. Those mosquito nets saved a lot of lives: is your money really more important than someone's life? Really, shouldn’t he be allowed to kill you and confiscate all your stuff?) The mistake is thinking that you have to act as if every human life has equal value. In fact, behaving morally means accepting that you owe some people a particular duty, so you should prioritise your own family over some stranger on the other side of the planet. It means having loyalty to your friends and your neighbours, and, yes, to your country and your people too. In the end, it’s only <em>natural</em> to care more about your own kind. It's instinctive. This is what we, as humans, are; anything else is some kind of ideological aberration. The delusion of a people whose real human connections have all been wiped out by the modern world, who think they care about amoebae and Palestinians, but are actually incapable of caring about anyone at all except themselves.</p><p>This is, of course, historically illiterate bullshit. Yes, sure, there’s always been a human tendency to give greater moral weight to members of your own group. There’s <em>also</em> always been a human tendency to understand that all human lives are morally equivalent, because we are all ultimately the same. It’s there in Judaism: as I’ve written before, the single most repeated commandment in the Torah is for us to love the stranger among us, because we were once strangers in the land of Egypt. Thirty-six times. Seems important. Some of the people pushing this species of parochial ethics claim to be Christian, which is very strange, because Christianity is utterly hostile to all your petty identities and all your miserable traditions. ‘If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.’ The philosophical traditions of the Indian subcontinent might make strong distinctions between people from different castes, but they also refuse to distinguish between humans and insects: the doctrine of <em>ahimsa</em> insists that since all living beings are souls, and all souls circulate between various bodies, we have a baseline ethical duty to everything that breathes. The same idea underpins Pythagoras’ vegetarianism. In Book XV of the <em>Metamorphoses</em>, Ovid has the philosopher neatly join the two ethical systems: every animal we slaughter and eat, he wails, might have been home to ‘the spirits of our parents, or brothers, or those joined to us by some other bond, certainly human.’ Two thousand years before Bentham, China had Mozi, who built his philosophy around the principle of 兼愛, <em>jianai</em>, variously translated as <em>impartial concern </em>or <em>universal love</em>. He extends the principle of filial piety until it covers all human beings in the world without distinction, and it no longer matters whether or not someone happens to be your actual father. After all, if your highest value is to respect your own parents, it’s even better for <em>everyone</em> to respect your parents, and the best way to do that is by committing to respect <em>their</em> parents too. Universalism is easy, he says, much easier than constant war. It gets the job done. ‘Now if we are seeking to promote the world’s benefits and eliminate the world’s harms, we reject the partial as being wrong and choose the universal as being right.’ The book that bears his name is divided into five sections: the first four are made up of statements of philosophical principle and disputes with the Confucians; the fifth is a handbook on siege engineering. During the Warring States period, Mohists would travel across China, offering their skills to any city at risk of siege. In every war, they always fought for the defenders. They would be putting up barricades in Rafah. </p><p>You don't have to agree with these ideas. But they exist. They’re also a product of our human nature. It’s just that the part of our human nature they come from is our capacity for <em>reason</em>, and reactionaries don’t like that part so much; as far as they’re concerned, it somehow doesn’t count. They prefer to think of us as unthinking animals.</p><p>In the end, I think neither of our two terms really works on its own. You can’t actually care about people on the other side of the world unless you first care about the real, tangible people around you. As Ovid and Mozi understood, and Jesus too, the universal is an infinite extension of the particular. ‘Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.’ But at the same time, if you’re not capable of caring about the fate of people you’ve never met, who have nothing to offer you and nothing in common with you except the raw fact of being alive—if you really don’t think you have any duty to them at all, if you get <em>angry</em> at the suggestion that you might—then I don’t think you’re capable of really loving your family either. The soul that shrinks from the infinite shrinks into an infinitely small point.</p><div><hr></div><p>To be honest, I don’t think I even know my family well enough to put any kind of moral emphasis on them. Just the last few generations. Just the closest branches. </p><p>I’ve inherited two of Dave’s bookends. It’s unsettling now, being in his flat, where all his old things are still around, his books, his clothes: everything but the man. When you take something it feels less like the sucking absence of someone; it becomes an ordinary thing again. The bookends are made of wood and shaped like owls and my aunt can’t stand them, so now they’re mine. Before they were Dave’s they belonged to his father, my grandfather, who died when I was four years old. I don't remember him at all. Before that they might have belonged to Dave’s grandfather, my great-grandfather, whose name I can’t even remember. My entire existence depends on this man and I know nothing about him, except that I’ve got his owls. A few years ago, Dave worked with some researchers in eastern Europe to trace our ancestry back to the Pale of Settlement. He got a lot: names, dates of birth, weddings, everything that gets put down in the official records. But none of Canetti’s pile: not the memories, jokes, longings, the little habits of speech that would have made our ancestors into people instead of statistics. They didn’t write personal essays in the shtetl. Not like <a href="http://telavivrooftop.blogspot.com/">he did</a>. Those generations are silent: all we get is some of their stuff.</p><p>The oldest thing I own is an abridged edition of <em>Tristram Shandy</em>, published 1774. But a lot of my stuff is older than I am. All the bullshit midcentury teak furniture in my bullshit midcentury flat. The old Victorian perfume bottles my girlfriend found when she took me mudlarking on the Thames estuary. My cutlery, made in Sheffield, 1896. Half of my books. So many nice Penguin editions from the 1970s. I got them from second-hand bookshops, but where do the second-hand bookshops get them? From dead people. Where will they go after I die? To the second-hand bookshop. Right now these things are mine, but the lives of objects are much longer and slower than ours. I’m just a brief moment in their history, and they will not remember me to whoever has them next.</p><p>We buried Dave in Yarkon, the main municipal cemetery for Tel Aviv. It’s in Petah Tikva, a famously boring town on the outskirts of the city. Germans have a Reddity joke conspiracy theory that the city of Bielefeld doesn’t actually exist, since no one’s ever been there or met anyone from there; in Israel they have the same joke about Petah Tikva. But everyone goes there in the end. Since my uncle wasn’t remotely religious and didn’t belong to any synagogue, he was given the state-issued general-purpose Jewish funeral. There was a bearded rabbi in a baseball cap with a ring of keys on his belt, who took us through the service with as much tact as he could. He took a razor to my dad’s collar so he could rend his shirt. He didn’t say any words about the deceased, because he’d never known the deceased except as a motionless shape wrapped in a white shroud. They don’t use coffins in Israel. A few prayers, and then we put Dave into the ground. He got a grave on the fourth floor, which was nice. Under the sky.</p><p>Jews don’t believe in cremation. We don’t scatter our ashes on the beach or keep them on the mantelpiece. You have to be buried whole, so that on the Day of Resurrection you can rise out of your tomb in new pink flesh to share in the Olam HaBa. Until then, the Jews are filed away in our millions, like newspapers in a hoarder’s basement. You have to keep them all, every single one; even the people with no relatives, who no one ever visits. Nobody loses their spot. But Israel is a very small country, and it’s rapidly running out of room. This is the real conflict: the living are squeezed tighter and tighter into their cities, while the dead keep on multiplying, colonising the hills. Every time a new war between Israelis and Palestinians breaks out, the living lose a little more ground to the dead. But Yarkon Cemetery is pioneering a solution. Once its 150 acres were almost at capacity, with 110,000 graves, they started building up. The graveyard is now ringed with strange, ziggurat-like concrete structures. Multi-storey corpse parks. Each one has a circular ramp on one side for the golf buggies that carry the dead up to their graves. There’s a series of pits in the thick concrete floor, and when a body is buried the pit is filled with soil and closed up. The columns of these buildings are hollow and also filled with soil, so each grave is connected to the earth. There are only a few of these structures now, but Yarkon plans to build thirty more. It looked like a building site up there on the top floor, this concrete expanse littered with heaps of dirt. A few stubby columns poked out from the floor: if they ever need to, they can pile on a few extra storeys. From up there, I could see Tel Aviv, the skyscrapers, glittering fragments of the sea. On the other side the flat fields of the coastal plain stretched away, tangles of pylons, little clumps of trees—and beyond them, pale in the haze, the first low hills. Those hills in the middle distance were the West Bank. Palestine. It’s a very, very small place. </p><p>Each pit in the high-rise cemetery can take two bodies, one on top of the other. Another mourner told me that Yarkon had offered him a 25,000 shekel discount if he agreed to be buried, when the time came, on top of his mother. It’s not enough to deal with an overbearing Jewish mother all your life, now you have to keep on putting up with her once you’re dead. He said no.</p><p>There were a lot of distant relatives there. Israelis with West Midlands accents. I found myself unconsciously scanning their faces for anything that reminded me of myself. My fish lips, my wonky jaw, my grandmother’s blunted nose. I didn’t know these people, but they knew me. They’d met me when I was a little blond-haired baby. Now, they’d heard, I was a writer. And what did I write? ‘Everything, really,’ I’d say. ‘Culture stuff, features, reviews, whatever I can get paid for.’ And then their nose would twitch like a truffle-sniffing hog’s. ‘What about politics?’ Yes, I’d admit, I did sometimes write about politics too. One distant aunt asked me how I was dealing with all the antisemitism in England. I said I’d never once been the victim of any kind of antisemitism, ever in my life, and she sharply corrected me. ‘No. That’s not true. I’ve read about it. It’s terrible over there.’ When I admitted to a skinny, silver-haired man that I had written a little about the current war, he immediately launched into his own account of the situation. ‘It’s very blurry at the moment,’ he said. ‘Very unclear. We have no way of really knowing what’s going on in Gaza. Maybe some day it will clear and we’ll understand, but right now it’s all just very blurry.’ He knew. Of course he knew. Everyone knows. They know like the Germans knew, but it’s impossible to square that knowledge with the clear blue skies, the shade of the trees, the food, the beaches, the rhythms of ordinary life and ordinary death. Impossible to accept what is being done in the country where you’ve buried the people you love. So you say it’s all very blurry. It’s all very unclear. </p><p>A woman with a white plaster on the end of her nose also asked if I wrote about politics. When she pressed me on <em>what</em> I wrote about politics, I said I was working on a piece for an American publication about the fate of the American right, which I am. ‘You probably wouldn’t agree with me,’ she said. ‘I’m very much in the centre, very centre-right. But I’m always willing to talk to people when I disagree. Anyway, what you have to remember is that the Israeli right isn’t the same as the American right. Not like that Donald Trump. It’s different here.’ ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘but I don’t think the Israeli centre is the same as our centre either.’ It was like I’d flipped a switch buried somewhere in her brain. ‘We’re just fighting to survive in this country,’ she snapped suddenly. ‘I have three boys in Gaza right now. That’s all I have to say about that, you understand?’</p><p>I later learned that the woman with the plaster on her nose wasn’t actually a relation at all. She’d been my uncle’s next door neighbour back in Birmingham, before the entire community had decamped for the Middle East. Her version of being very much in the centre, very centre-right, was to live in Kiryat Arba, an illegal Israeli settlement overlooking the Palestinian city of Hebron. Itamar Ben Gvir lives there. I <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/notes-from-a-normal-country">travelled through the place</a> a few years ago. Its biggest attraction is the grave of Baruch Goldstein, an American settler who walked into the Haram al-Ibrahimi in Hebron and opened fire, murdering twenty-nine worshippers. At his funeral, Dov Lior, the Chief Rabbi of Kiryat Arba, said that ‘Goldstein was full of love for fellow human beings. He dedicated himself to helping others.’ The people who live in Kiryat Arba are psychos, even by Israeli standards. I was very relieved to learn she’s not a blood relation. Makes it easier to shunt this particular fellow-creature outside my moral circle. </p><div><hr></div><p>It’s amazing how quickly things pass. I’d spent the flight thinking about the funeral, wandered around Tel Aviv thinking about the funeral, gone to sleep thinking about the funeral, and now it was already over. We left Dave in Petah Tikva, piled into our cars, and drove back to Tel Aviv without him. </p><p>In the end I did go down to the beach. Sat on the sand with my dad and my cousins as the sun went down over the Mediterranean. It was very beautiful. I’m sure plenty of people were sitting on beaches in Gaza at exactly the same time, watching the same sun inch towards the same glowing sea. I’m sure plenty of them had buried family members too. I know it’s not the same; of course it’s not the same. The city behind me was full of light and noise; there was a gay pride festival happening in the park, leaking the low thump of club music. The city behind them is gone. Ruins littered with corpses. But nobody lives without tragedy, because being alive is a tragic experience. There is a baseline of heartbreak and suffering that comes with being here, and while we can make things <em>worse</em> for each other if we want, you can’t ever get rid of it. And it’s precisely because it can be so shit, because it’s shit for absolutely everyone who lives, that we have the infinite and absolute duty to every other human being not to make things any worse.</p><p>Eventually the sun touched the waves. The circle became a half. Then just a glowing orange sliver, tiny and vanishing, above the sea. Sometimes you can really see the seconds evaporating in front of you. The vast invisible spheres that carry you, whether you like it or not, from one instant into the next. Their movement is steady and indifferent and it will not change. I watched as the sliver of fire got smaller and smaller and finally disappeared. I didn’t feel at peace. I wanted a rope. A hook. Something to fling at the horizon. Drag it back up! If we all grab the ropes and heave, maybe we can we pull it out the water. Tear it screaming against the grain of the sky. There must be something. A harpoon. A Book Against Time. Something, so for once, just this one time, the wheel might turn the other way. Bring it back. Bring it back! </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5863bfee-1192-4501-aab9-45c6c95c4bee_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5863bfee-1192-4501-aab9-45c6c95c4bee_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5863bfee-1192-4501-aab9-45c6c95c4bee_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5863bfee-1192-4501-aab9-45c6c95c4bee_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5863bfee-1192-4501-aab9-45c6c95c4bee_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5863bfee-1192-4501-aab9-45c6c95c4bee_1280x960.jpeg" width="1200" height="900" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5863bfee-1192-4501-aab9-45c6c95c4bee_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:306340,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-large" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5863bfee-1192-4501-aab9-45c6c95c4bee_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5863bfee-1192-4501-aab9-45c6c95c4bee_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5863bfee-1192-4501-aab9-45c6c95c4bee_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5863bfee-1192-4501-aab9-45c6c95c4bee_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div>

If you know anything at all about how humans have traditionally structured our world, you’ll know that this is bullshit. The left-right divide is older than the French Revolution, and also older than the monarchies of Europe. It stretches deep into our prehistory. It might be older than the human species.</p><p>Things that resemble the left-right spectrum do seem to show up a lot, in strange corners of the world. The people of the southwestern United States have traditionally organised the universe along the four cardinal directions. So, for instance, among the Zuni, the west is associated with the colour blue, the bear, the coyote, redtop grass, the clans named after those totems, priesthood, archery, and water. The north has yellow, the pelican, the grouse, the oak, their clans, the cactus band, warfare, and air. Other people have a similar system, but populate it differently. For the Ojibwe, the west is black and associated with buffalo, deer, and death. For the Navajo, west is yellow, feminine, and abalone shell. You can see traces of the same thing even when directions aren’t involved: In Australia, the Wakelbura divide the entire phenomenal and mystical world between two moieties, Wutaru and Mullera. The sun is Wutaru, the moon is Mullera. Emu and bandicoot are Wutaru, dog and kangaroo are Mullera. Honey might be either Wutaru or Mullera, depending on which type of bee produced it. When a member of a Wutaru clan dies, his body must be exposed on a platform made from the wood of a Wutaru tree. </p><p>This stuff is not restricted to primitive societies. Medieval chronicles referred to the coast of Dalmatia as ‘Red Croatia,’ because in the Slavic cardinal system the south is red; the original homeland of the Croats was ‘White Croatia,’ somewhere near the Carpathian mountains. In the twentieth century, there was a region of Outer Manchuria, up against the fringes of Korea, that had been settled by people from the opposite end of the Russian Empire; they called it Green Ukraine. East is green. And the Australian system should not be unfamiliar to anyone who’s encountered a Romance language. In French, a book, an arm, and a coat are all masculine, while a page, a leg, and a jacket are feminine. Spanish distinguishes between a masculine knife, <em>el cuchillo</em>, and a feminine spoon, <em>la cuchara</em>. Here is the trap left for the slightly smart. Knife: violent, penetrating, penis, man. Spoon: receptive, containing, vagina, woman. Completely wrong. The masculine objects do not belong to men and the feminine objects do not belong to women; the universe is cleaved by a division as cosmic as the one between Wutaru and Mullera. Biological sex is just one minor feature of grammatical gender; men are just another object, like books, arms, and coats, that belong to one side of the invisible line that organises the world.</p><p>It’s the same with left and right. The actual directions are just an echo. The political division came first.</p><p>Look at left and right handedness, which are already a metaphor. The right: dumb, majoritarian, conformist, constantly confusing itself for nature. The left: a pesky and persecuted minority, always trying to invert the settled way of doing things, and usually making things difficult for everyone else. Jesus separates the sheep (obedient, herdlike) to his right from the goats (wilful, questioning) to his left. Later he ascends to Heaven, to sit by the right hand of God. In Tantric traditions, the more orthodox sects are <em>dakshinachara</em>, or right-handed. They emphasise balance, serenity, and austerity. But there’s another path to the godhead, which seeks out the universal mind through chaos, delirium, drunkenness, and sex; this is the <em>vamachara</em>, or left-hand path. Yang is on the right. Yin is on the left. This stuff has been woven into the way we move through the world for a very long time. When a band of chimpanzees moves in formation across the forest floor, alpha out front, notice which side his most senior lieutenant takes. In 1789, the monarchists would never have agreed to sit on the left side of the Constituent Assembly, because they were <em>already on the right</em>.</p><p>Still, every few months, someone emerges to declare that the left-right model of politics is obsolete and we need to scrap it for something else. A popular replacement is the division between inside and outside: inside you have the neoliberal consensus and its armies of smug, credentialed ideological clones; outside, the teeming horde of unvaccinated maniacs. Repeated attempts to build some kind of left-right populist coalition of the outside. The problem, though, is that as soon as representatives of the outside gain any kind of political power, they become, to some degree at least, insiders, which means that instead of a neat circle you have to plot your politics on one of those four-dimensional cubes that’s continually folding in on itself. Another model is the one based on speed: there’s an accelerationist politics that wants to propel us forwards into fully automated gay space communism or the AI crypto hustle thunderdome, and a regressive politics that wants to pull the emergency brake of history or retvrn to some plague-ridden late medieval idyll. Obviously I’m very interested in the idea that politics is ultimately a question of <em>controlling the flow of time</em>, but since time has continued to move at exactly one second per second regardless of who’s in power, it doesn’t feel like a particularly useful model. Thomas Friedman once tried to divide the world into ‘web people’ and ‘wall people.’ This is pleasingly insane. We could try out some others. A political spectrum split between the Party of the Sun (Leninists, reactionaries) and the Party of the Moon (liberals, anarchists). Maybe in the background there’s the unimaginable politics of the stars. Or we could divide the world between birdism, migratory, globalist, and beastism, rooted, wallowing. It’s fun. But if you want to actually understand reality, I still think the old left-right model is the only one that makes sense. As I’ve written before, politics is only really meaningful if it can be plotted on that axis. Dig into anything that claims to be entirely off the map, and you’ll usually find there’s nothing but fascism and styrofoam inside. There will always be a right. There will always be a left.</p><p>But even I can admit that lately, things have been getting weird. </p><p>These terms are differential; they only have meaning relative to each other. The actual content is indeterminate. Most of the time left is the opposite of right, and vice versa. But every so often, we go through a period of crisis, in which all our politics go gooey and swirl together like an insect in a chrysalis. What comes out afterwards is usually, in terms of the previous setup, a contradiction in terms. Last time it happened, we ended up with conservatives trying to radically reshape all of human society according to their utopian vision, while the left were reduced to sitting around getting misty-eyed about the good old days of postwar social democracy. Another mutation appears to be happening now. Entire ideologies are going extinct. New ones sprouting, soft and pale, like mushrooms on a fallen tree. What emerges afterwards will still be a left and a right, but they won’t look anything like the left and the right you know. They’ll look like this:</p><h4>Left: Elite human capitalism</h4><p>There is going to be a woke 2. I’m not good at much, but I am usually ahead of the curve on the precise trajectory of wokeness. Already in 2021 I was writing that ‘the ideological frenzy of the last few years is starting to die down. People are quietly, guiltily removing the pronouns from their email signatures. Last Thanksgiving, there were slightly fewer articles about how to hold your uncle personally accountable for three hundred years of American racism.’ About a year later, I was the first person to write about the phenomenon entirely in the past tense. Now, everyone else has caught up, which means that somewhere, woke 2 is already gestating, in one of the hidden wombs of the world. For a while, I thought we still had an opportunity. If woke 2 is inevitable, maybe a few ideological entrepreneurs can get in on the ground floor and point it in a less obnoxious direction than the last version. You can have a lot of leverage when you’re early. But I think it’s already too late. The next iteration is already half-formed, and it is a wet unborn monster, worse than anything we could have imagined.</p><p>If we are about to see the emergence of woke 2, it’s because woke 1 fulfilled an important ideological need, which is now going unmet. It’s boring to keep harping on about the nature of wokeness in 2025, so I’ll be brief: its function was to justify the position of the ruling classes in a way that doesn’t acknowledge the actual substance of that position, which is the property relation. In place of the exploitation that undergirds the world, it presented a vast mishmash of various forms of prejudice, hatred, and exclusion, which could be embodied in entirely ordinary words, hand gestures, or sometimes large and inert rocks. (In 2021, a racist boulder was removed from the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.) It is not easy to be a good person, it takes a level of scrupulous ritual observance usually only found among ultra-orthodox Jews. But as it turns out, the most conscientious and sensitive people are in the ruling classes. They are <em>more egalitarian than everyone else</em>. This is how companies that make machines for scooping out the eyes of African war orphans ended up lecturing their workers on how to be less oppressive.</p><p>It was all very clever. Unfortunately, it turned out that people respond very, very badly to this kind of moral condescension. The backlash has been so intense that it’s now socially acceptable to espouse outright skull-measuring scientific racism in public. If our object is to build a more egalitarian society, woke 1 was an incredible failure. But that was never the point. Which is why woke 2 will be the dialectical synthesis of the smug hectoring of wokeness and the skull-measuring scientific racism that replaced it.</p><p>For most of the last century, progressivism has implied at least some kind of vague rhetorical commitment to egalitarianism. But there’s no <em>necessary</em> reason why the two should always go together. In the nineteenth century, nothing was more progressive than eugenics. In Dostoevsky’s <em>Demons</em>, Shigalyov can imagine a liberated, scientific, progressive future in which ninety percent of humanity is reduced to total slavery, and not see any contradiction. Rather than continue going through the rigmarole of inventing egalitarian alibis for a fundamentally unequal society, the mainstream centre-left might just find another myth. Currently, the ideologies of explicit hierarchy are mostly found on the right, but there’s nothing keeping them there. We are in a gooey age, where all boundaries disappear. </p><p>Maybe the greatest ideological entrepreneur of our era is Richard Hanania. Far more than any of his competitors—Curtis Yarvin, Bronze Age Pervert, me—he seems to prefigure the politics of the future. Hanania is a columnist and the president of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology, which is something he made up with his friend Eric. His ideological trajectory has gone something like this. Fifteen years ago, Hanania was an outright white racist, writing sentences like ‘White nationalism is the only hope that part of what made the American nation great will survive somewhere.’ He believed that white people form a distinct genetic unit with particular qualities, such as IQ, that make them, on average, intrinsically better than other people. (Hanania is Palestinian. According to the US Census Bureau, this makes him white. Historically, others have disagreed. There might be more than one reason he wrote all this stuff under a pseudonym.) Later, he moved into the more mainstream right-wing media, publishing various forms of anti-woke blather, some of which has informed the policies of the current Trump administration, without much to indicate that any of his underlying beliefs had changed. But slowly he started to notice something. He believed that white people were smarter and more capable than everyone else, but most of the smart and successful <em>individuals</em> seemed to believe in some kind of liberal anti-racism, whereas most of the people who agreed with <em>him</em> seemed to have small pools of custard in their brains. </p><p>In the last few years, Hanania has made a kind of aretaic turn. Instead of the white race, he now believes in a universal herrenvolk stratum of ‘elite human capital.’ He now supports gay marriage and trans rights, because gay and trans people tend to be wealthier, more liberal, and higher IQ, and because openness to sexual minorities seems to be a trait of elite human capital. He supports abortion, and quotes Jessica Valenti while doing so. He opposes Trump and the MAGA movement, because they’re all plainly morons. He no longer opposes mass immigration, because it provides a wider talent pool from which elite human capital might be drawn, even if it’s statistically likelier to come from some groups than others. He likes Jews. He has rearranged his Hitler particles into an almost perfect facsimile of liberalism, with just one piece missing, which is the assumption of a universal human dignity. Perhaps relatedly, he also believes that he, as an instance of elite human capital, could easily write a Jacobean tragedy as good as any of Shakespeare’s, if he had a few days to learn all the old-timey words. </p><p>I hate to say it, but I think this thing might have legs. The centre-left is hollowed out, it’s empty, its current best idea for 2028 is just running Kamala Harris again in the hope that things go differently. That space is there to be filled, and what makes elite human capitalism potent is that it doesn’t just flatter the position of the ruling classes—they have plenty of options on that front—but also provides the materials for an entirely new round of shrieking moral priggishness. It’s not hard to imagine a future in which your HR department will force you into annual trainings on your moral duty to build and develop your human capital. You are not a soul, or an ends in yourself; you are an instrument. Be the best instrument you can be! Celebrities drummed out of public life for displaying low-human capital traits. Listening to music without headphones on public transport. Drunk driving. Don’t you know the <em>harm</em> that causes? Do better! Be better! Maybe in a few years you’ll accidentally use a non-EHC word in conversation and everyone around you will start grimacing. A muscular, technocratic, progressive, elitist, and utterly philistine left. It really could work. But not for Hanania himself. After all, he used to be an outright white supremacist, and what could be less EHC than <em>that</em>? Our present might be able to forgive him. His future will not.</p><h4>Centre: Urothumocracy</h4><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>The strange thing about the revival in ideologies of innate human inequality is that it’s happening at precisely the moment when all of this stops even slightly mattering. In particular, it’s weird that so much IQ-mongering goes on in tech-adjacent circles, given that those same circles believe we’re on the cusp of an artificial intelligence whose IQ will be effectively infinite. Next to the dispersed singularitarian gigabrain, the difference between the elitest of elite human capital and the lowest dregs out of a Louisiana cousinfucking factory is about the same as the difference between any two ants. So who cares?</p><p>I do not think we are about to witness the birth of a runaway superintelligence, but I do think that AI is already having a levelling effect on human abilities. You can see it happening right in front of you. People are sitting down in restaurants, showing the menu to ChatGPT, and asking it to decide their order for them. Right now, someone is sending AI-generated flirting to a girl on Hinge, and she’s sending him AI-generated coquetry back. Everyone I know in academia is in the midnight of a deep despair, because none of the students are producing their own writing or even their own thoughts any more. Meanwhile, the students genuinely can’t imagine how anyone made it through university before 2022, without the machine that could do all your work for you. </p><p>This is the end of a very long process. By the end of the Neolithic, we had developed the lever, the axle, and the pulley, three simple machines that effectively neutralised human muscle-power. Instead of an intrinsic personal quality, strength becomes an abstracted and deployable unit. A weak man or a strong man tugging on the same pulley will achieve the same result. It was probably inevitable that we’d end up doing the same thing to our minds. I don’t think AI will ever be smarter than a human being, in the same way that a lever will never be <em>stronger </em>than you are. Individual intelligence will just cease to matter once everyone is using the same prosthesis to automate all their thoughts.</p><p>This is bad news for politics. All democratic ideologies assume, at a minimum, a society of thinking individuals with their own interests and preferences. The role of politics is to represent those preferences on the level of the state. (Sometimes, admittedly, it’s to engineer those preferences, but this happens a lot less than people think.) But that society of thinking individuals is vanishing. What happens when it’s gone?</p><p>The obvious solution is to just let AI take over governance. It’s entirely possible for the machines to take over the world without ever gaining sentience or rebelling against their human makers. In fact, this is not even a particularly new idea. Kings used to go to war on the say-so of sibyls and astrologers, who were also distilling a crude artificial intelligence out of the movements of the stars. The Israelite high priests would receive policy ideas directly from God through the urim and thummim, which were small black and white stones used for drawing lots. Chinese emperors traditionally delegated part of their sovereign power to the I Ching. The oracles we have today are very powerful. Their ideas might not always be so bad. </p><p>I asked ChatGPT how it would fix the British economy, given total political power but the usual non-political constraints (capital flight, gilt market instability, armed insurrection). It said it would impose light-touch capital controls, including a requirement for pension funds and insurers to invest in domestic assets, introduce yield curve controls, redirect speculative capital away from the housing market and into productive industries by replacing council tax with a land value tax and massively increasing state-led housing construction, invest in green energy, semiconductors, and biotech, extend HS2, introduce sector-based migration quotas, and offer free vocational training to anyone who wants it.</p><p>This really isn’t bad. Serious, coherent, long-term policy. It’s certainly a lot better than what the Labour party are currently offering. Of course it is: even if he weren’t fundamentally useless, Keir could never dream of proposing this stuff. Introducing yield curve controls requires <em>ending the independence of the Bank of England</em>. Politically impossible. A land value tax would mean going up against the Satan-worshipping rentier class that’s ruled this island through blood magic and ritual murder since 1066. No human politician could ever do this, not within a democratic framework. But a chatbot <em>could</em>. The people that @ Grok into all their online arguments would happily embrace the opposite of everything they believed if it were spat out of an AI. Do not be surprised if, as ordinary messy politics continues to lead us nowhere, more and more people start demanding the sane, apolitical government of the machines. And sometimes, I can feel it too. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could be a reasonably prosperous country again, in the same way that the student who gets ChatGPT to write all her essays is guaranteed a perfectly reasonable B-? Would that really be so bad?</p><p>This has been imagined before. Leibniz dreamed of a day when it would be possible to ‘end controversies and impose silence on the sects,’ because whenever two people disagreed on what was good or beautiful, instead of engaging in any kind of agnostic debate, or resorting to violence, they could just get out their thinking machines and say: <em>Calculemus!</em> ‘Let us calculate.’ But Leibniz was not the only German to dream of imposing silence on the sects. In the political theology of Carl Schmitt, chief juristic philosopher of the Third Reich, the essence of democracy is <em>acclamation</em>. Not the constant squabbling of different factions sharing out the social spoils, but the people united, expressing a single will. And that single will is, of course, to stop willing, to invest all power in a single sovereign, and to willingly submit to him. And this is exactly what the people who want to be governed by small pebbles will be doing. One last exercise of our collective democratic power, in which we demand to stop having to ever exercise that power ever again. Afterwards, what will happen to the people who insist on using their own minds, generating thoughts without the imprimatur of Claude or Grok? According to Schmitt, democracy has two requirements. ‘First homogeneity, and second—if the need arises—elimination or eradication of heterogeneity.’</p><p>But the problem with rule by chatbot isn’t just that it’s fascist; it’s that it’s unable to even do fascism right. After asking ChatGPT how it would fix the British economy, I also asked it to remember the quote from somewhere in his major works where Carl Schmitt talks about going to the circus as a child and seeing an elephant. It was eager to help. Apparently, the quote is from page 71 of the Polity Press edition of <em>Politische Theologie II</em>, translated by Hoelzl and Ward. ‘When I was a child and saw the elephant at the circus for the first time,’ Schmitt writes, ‘I was struck dumb. It was simply there, vast and undeniable, needing no explanation. That was power.’ I then asked it to remind me of the Philip Roth quote about seeing an elephant at the circus, which is in <em>Portnoy’s Complaint</em>, on page 76 in the Vintage edition. ‘I remember standing there staring at that beast, thinking: well, there’s one creature who has no guilt about what comes out of him.’ I then said I was trying to find the bit about the elephant in Geoffrey of Monmouth’s <em>Historia Regnum Britanniae</em>. Book VII, section 2: ‘Monstrata sunt populo multa mirabilia. Inter cetera vero elephantus, qui ab extremis orbis terrarum partibus traductus esse dicebatur.’ </p><p>My point isn’t that AI is unfit to govern because unlike Leibniz’s calculating machine it sometimes gets things <em>wrong</em>. The point is that AI recognises no particular difference between true and untrue statements, because at root it’s a machine for predicting the next token in a text string. In other words, its nature is to give you exactly what you want at any given time. If you want a mediocre essay on <em>Hamlet</em>, it’ll give you that; if you want to know what a dead Nazi jurist had to say about elephants, it’ll do its best. I asked for a plan to fix the British economy, and it gave me a plan perfectly targeted at the kind of person who pretends to understand Adam Tooze, ie me. It only really works under democratic conditions, in the non-Schmittian sense of an agnostic space containing heterogenous accounts of the good. For it to give you what you want, it needs a world in which people have wants. But those are exactly the conditions that AI obliterates. Once we no longer want anything, once we’ve stopped expressing our own accounts of the good, once we’ve surrendered all our political will to the machine, the machine will have nothing to work with. There’s a little knot of impossibility at the heart of sensible AI-mediated apolitical Führerprinzipialismus, which is that if the ideology were ever actually realised, the entire structure of desire supporting it would instantly collapse. In this, it’s exactly like every other ideology ever proposed in human history. Expect it to spread.</p><h4>Right: Reactionary cyborg feminism</h4><p>What will ultimately check the spread of artificial centrism is the fact that these machines are fundamentally unsexed, dickless, and politics is now just one minor theatre in the gender war. To recap, if you’ve not been following: there are men and women. Men are, on average, taller, more violent, and governed by the phallic signifier, whereas women are shorter, more annoying, and not fully codable through the symbolic order. Because men and women are not complementary halves but entirely separate orders, the circuit of desire cannot be closed, and there is no possible sexual relation. To paper over our fundamental asymmetry, we construct a mediating fantasy of the other in which the sexual partner represents the satisfaction of a desire that can never actually be satisfied. This system wasn’t perfect, but it worked for a long time, until in the early twenty-first century all our mediating fantasies suddenly stopped being able to mediate, the hologram of the sexual relation flickered and disappeared, all the young people stopped fucking and started spending all day criticising each other’s facial imperfections online, global birthrates plummeted, and relations between the terms ‘male’ and ‘female’ collapsed into outright war.</p><p>This is not to say that the sexual relation wasn’t always riven by ambivalence and violence, often deadly violence, but for most of history the struggle was on the field of sexuality and the self. The question was how you could approach your own need as embodied in the other. Not any more! Men and women now face each other as mutually hostile aliens, directly competing in the labour market, in cultural institutions, and, as partisan politics realigns itself on gender lines, in democratic elections. The conflict now extends to what look like entirely sexless fields: trade policy, energy infrastructure, the optimal interest rate. Trump’s brief global tariffs, for example, were celebrated by a certain sector of men on the assumption that while, yes, they would lead to short-term economic collapse, that collapse would be <em>bad for women</em>. In the new, tough America, their degrees in vulva studies would be worthless, and their fake six-figure gen-z-boss-and-a-mini email jobs would vanish. All the job growth would be in low-skilled, physically demanding primary industry, forcibly remasculinising a new generation of muscular factory workers. Politically disempowered, the women would have no choice except to depend economically on men again, and start having lots of babies.</p><p>Increasingly, this kind of psychosis—not a value judgement, just the psychoanalytically accurate term—is going to form the sole substance of mainstream right-wing politics. Since time immemorial, the right has stood on the twin pillars of snobbery and racism. But as this real estate is occupied by a left-coded elite human capitalism, the right will become substantially more multiracial, anti-racist, and demotic. You can get a glimpse of our future by looking at South Korea, where the sexes are even more alienated from each other than in the west, and birthrates lower than anywhere else in the world. In 2022, Yoon Suk-yeol was elected to the presidency on a platform of militant antifeminism. The grey-faced tribune for the millions of unemployed, unwanted, sexually inactive men. In 2024, Yoon declared martial law and attempted to arrest his political opponents along with various left-wing public figures; in the end he was forced out of office by a coalition of centrist politicians and k-pop idols. This is not the end of this particular story, but the American version is likely to be a little different. It might be surprisingly Islamicate. (A quarter century of liberal imperialism has done a lot to associate political misogyny with the teachings of the Prophet.) Andrew Tate is the model here: his conversion to Islam hasn’t stopped him drinking or pimping, but it has given trad substance to his straightforward degeneracy. You might see some kind of secular niqab as a prophylactic against thottery, AI filters enforcing digital purdah, emphasis on homosociality, homoeroticism, immaculately trimmed beards, godliness without pity, white boys wearing the thobe, maybe a bacha bazi-style system of organised pederasty. Donald Trump will probably not publicly convert to Islam, not while the genocide in Gaza is still ongoing. But Barron might. </p><p>But all this analysis is pretty familiar; there’s been no end of attempts to probe the sexual pathologies of the right. Weirdly, though, a lot of it implicitly accepts the right’s own framing: educated women are more interested in their own self-actualisation than settling down with loser men, and now the loser men have turned into violent fascists in a fit of sexual frustration. But that’s not the whole story, because the crisis of fantasy has happened everywhere, and to everyone. The men aren’t frustrated; they’re limpdicked, pornsick, they can’t perform, they’re in the full throes of aphanisis, their sexual ideal is a two-dimensional pink-haired eleven-year-old anime girl, and the real function of their political psychosis is to conceal their <em>lack</em> of desire. What about the lonely, frustrated <em>women</em>? What strange new politics might emerge there?</p><p>If you spend any time engaging with feminism, you’ll have noticed that of all the many multicoloured versions that emerged during the 2010s, there’s only really one form that still has any kind of social or political relevance. This is reactionary feminism, the Mary Harrington ideology. Reactionary feminism is a feminism without women’s liberation, lightly Dworkinite but also very spiritually british; no-nonsense, biologistic, terfy, pragmatic, deeply suspicious of the heterosexual relation, but without being particularly lesbian. Reactionary feminism embraces traditional marriage, and everything that comes with it: childbirth, housework, drudgery; women up all night darning someone’s socks. Not because it puts any value on romantic love, but because traditional marriage tends to restrain men and their more brutal capacities. Everything else is worse. When we become sexually liberated, when we slough off five thousand years of patriarchy and start playing around with freedom and pleasure and kink, the result is that a lot more women get hurt. Reactionary feminism is generally suspicious of anything that promises to emancipate us from our biological limits, including contraception. Increasingly, reactionary feminists are worried about birthrates and immigration. About how quiet, civil people are being outbred in their own countries by newcomers from the raw and humid centre of the world.</p><p>Like all dominant ideologies, reactionary feminism is obsessed with the phantom of its most recent predecessor. Here that’s cyborg feminism, of the type espoused by people like Sophie Lewis. The cyborg vision, expressed in books like <em>Full Surrogacy Now</em>, is of a world in which people are liberated from the restrictive assumptions that currently hold together the reproductive order. That reproduction is a part of <em>nature</em>, that a person who performs gestational labour necessarily has to be a <em>woman</em>, or a <em>mother</em>, or that children somehow <em>belong</em> to the adults that share their genes or perform the labour that brings them into being. Against the confines of motherhood and family, Lewis wants us to recognise that ‘we are all, at root, responsible. We are the makers of one another. And we could learn collectively to act like it… Let’s bring about the conditions of possibility for open-source, fully collaborative gestation. Let’s prefigure a way of manufacturing one another noncompetitively. Let’s hold one another hospitably, explode notions of hereditary parentage, and multiply real, loving solidarities. Let us build a care commune based on comradeship, a world sustained by kith and kind more than by kin. Where pregnancy is concerned, let every pregnancy be for everyone. Let us overthrow, in short, the family.’</p><p>This might sound utopian (or dystopian, depending on your view), but I think it really might happen. It’s just that it won’t be happening among the genderhackers, gynepunks, and comradely queer communities of care that Lewis imagined. You should know where this is going. Like all strong ideological oppositions in our gooey age, this is about to produce another monstrous birth. The future belongs to a <em>reactionary cyborg feminism.</em></p><p>The problem is the men. The men are constantly complaining about the world, but this is a sexual landscape built entirely around their mode of desire. Not so long ago, you would have assumed that a thirty-five-year-old man without a wife and kids must be gay. Now, it’s perfectly ordinary. The men get to flit from Hinge date to Hinge date, sipping like hummingbirds from the great bouquet of pussy that’s been laid out for them. They never have to commit to anything, and they can make you feel like a maniac for even expecting it. It’s all just fun. But the secret, the great hidden asymmetry, is that while men need women to make babies, women do not need men. All they really need is a vial of refrigerated cum. We already know that right-wing natalism is shedding the nuclear family structure; just look at Elon Musk. Eventually the reactionary feminists will have to abandon hope in domesticity, and get real. The cyborg dream will be realised in communes of pragmatic, no-nonsense women. They will not have children out of intense love towards a person who doesn’t even exist yet. Instead, they will collectively undergo gestational labour out of an ideological commitment to the abstract idea of having lots of children. They will not confuse incubating and birthing someone with <em>being a mother</em>. They will reject the possessiveness and exclusivity of love. All care will be decentralised, efficient, adequate. As the men of the right gorge themselves on misogyny and paedophilia, these communes are where most childbirth will end up taking place. Their children will inherit whatever is left of the world.</p>

Rishi Sunak is now our first non-white PM. How should we feel about this? The ordinary people they interview on TV keep insisting that they don’t remotely care, but the TV keeps asking them; clearly there’s <em>someone</em> who cares, or someone who cares about whether or not anyone cares. A few people in India seem <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/sunak-s-rise-to-top-job-moment-of-pride-for-indians/6805917.html">happy</a>; Americans are being <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/-daily-show-faces-backlash-segments-rishi-sunak-rcna54305">predictably weird</a>. The official stance of the Labour Party is that this is a great and wonderful thing, to the point that a Labour MP (also of Indian origin) was forced to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-63405307">delete a tweet</a> in which she suggested that Sunak’s Punjabi granny might be less important than his actual intentions with the country. It is nice to live in a democracy.</p><p>You should know the drill by now. As actual governance is outsourced to financial institutions, political discourse abandons the question of what politicians can <em>do for you</em>, and starts revolving around the question of <em>what they are</em>. Americans are particularly good at this stuff. Hillary Clinton was, famously, a woman. She might have also had some other political and human qualities, but any discussion of those was widely held to be cruel and bigoted, and motivated entirely by the only salient fact about her, which is that she is a woman. Barack Obama was intermittently black, when it suited him, but mostly he was <em>young</em>. Being black suits Kamala Harris better; Donald Trump was consistently acknowledged as white. </p><p>In Britain we do things slightly differently. The Conservatives are smart about this: they drop promising ethnic-minority candidates into safe white rural seats, usher them into the Cabinet, and never, ever mention what they’re doing. But Labour are stupid; they <a href="https://labour.org.uk/about/diversifying-parliament/">talk quotas</a>. Maybe like the Americans, they haven’t noticed just how <em>conservative</em> this personality-politics really is. In the UK, we’ve already shattered that highest, hardest glass ceiling, and it was Margaret Thatcher wot did it. But you still get scenes like Yvette Cooper’s in 2015. ‘Who’s the real radical? Jeremy Corbyn? Or <a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/yvette-cooper-i-am-real-radical-labour-leadership-choice-not-jeremy-corbyn-1515326">me, a woman</a>?’ </p><p>The usual name for this complex is <em>identitarianism</em> or <em>identity politics</em>, but I think it’s really just a facet of something much bigger. Call it <em>political perversion</em>. Freud, in his <em>Three Essays</em>, describes sexual perversion as any deviation from the straightforward heterosexual aim, which is cumming inside; political perversion is any deviation from the straightforward aim of politics, which is the reorganisation of society along your preferred lines. The political pervert keeps taking his eyes off the prize: he gets lost in signals and symbols and fetishes. Politics becomes a secret pleasure, or a kind of adornment for the self: I believe <em>this</em>, I support <em>this</em>, because I’m a <em>good person</em>. Protesters want to be <em>looked at</em> more than they want any particular change. Elected officials take office to promote their Instagram accounts. Referenda are won to <em>send a message</em>. You vote for whoever will make your ideological enemies most upset. Nothing ever happens, and everything means too much. </p><p>When critics notice this, they usually start encouraging us to drop the bullshit and get down to <em>real politics</em>. Remember what’s at stake! But maybe it’s not so easy. Freud writes like a baffled alien, blankly observing he madness of human affairs. Even in the most straight-laced circles, perversion reigns. ‘The kiss is held in high sexual esteem among many nations (including the most highly civilised ones), in spite of the fact that the parts of the body involved do not form part of the sexual apparatus but constitute the entrance to the digestive tract.’ A genuinely non-perverse sexual relation is inconceivable; without some kind of perversion we’re just joylessly slapping bodies against each other. And the people who do choose to forgo the kiss, or any meaningful relation to the sexual object—they’re perverts too: they don’t get off on the mechanical act of <em>fucking</em> a total stranger, but the symbolic act of fucking <em>a total stranger</em>. Sex itself is not that interesting. We start out polymorphously perverse; every orthopraxy must float on a dark sea of deviation. Politics works the same way. I am not a particularly political person, and I’m not very good at writing about politics, but there’s no such thing as politics, not any more. I am a pervert. I am lost in the spectacle of it all, and so are you. </p><div><hr></div><h4>July 14th, 2022: Kemi</h4><p>Because I sometimes write <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/writer/sam-kriss">for the </a><em><a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/writer/sam-kriss">Spectator</a></em>, I support Olukemi Badenoch in the Conservative leadership election. Kemi is a political pervert. Her campaign has nothing in particular to say about jobs, energy, transport, trade, or foreign or fiscal policy, but she does have very clearly articulated views on woke millennials (bad), the legacy of the British Empire (not that bad) and trans women (men). Her gambit is to say all these things while also being of Nigerian ancestry, which only surprises people who don’t know many Nigerians. She represents the people of Saffron Walden, the most sparsely inhabited constituency in Essex: endless flat miles of canola fields and charming thatched-roof towns with names like Wimbish and Great Sampford and Ugley Green. Poky parochial England, small and far from everywhere. Haystack idylls, wildflowers by the motorways and anonymous abattoirs where the cattle scream, all sustained by the biggest employer in the region, which is Stansted Airport, the big ugly rift in reality through which the rest of the world comes teeming in. </p><p>The people of Saffron Walden love Kemi Badenoch and so do I. So much that I don’t think she should even bother running for the leadership. Elections are for lesser creatures. She already has Saffron Walden, the heart of Olde England, the thing that must be defended at all costs; it’s simply waiting to be unleashed. </p><p>She should stand in the market square, beneath the half-timbered tourist information centre, and gather her followers: five hundred of the reddest, most swollen men in Essex. March them down the M11 to storm Bishop’s Stortford just over the boundary, and annex it to her constituency. Saffron Walden <a href="https://members.parliament.uk/constituency/3713/location">surrounds</a> the strategic town of Chelmsford on three sides; it would be easy to pulverise the place into submission with mobile artillery. Seize Witham and display Priti Patel’s head over the entrance to the big Tesco’s. The people of Saffron Walden might be few, but they have a leader, and their enemies have none. The south Cambridgeshire seats will fall quickly as Anthony Browne MP and Lucy Frazer MP, cowards both, dissolve their constituencies into Greater Saffron Walden—and with their reserves of alarmingly bloated men at her disposal, Kemi can besiege Cambridge itself, sack the University, and confiscate all their pronouns. Our armies gibber as the libraries burn. Punters poke through human gristle floating in the drowsy Cam. Maybe she could make a feint for the coast around Southend while the main body of her forces marches on London. As Mao understood, the countryside surrounds the city. In the ruins of Westminster, in the wreckage of the failed state we once called the United Kingdom, the Empire of Saffron Walden will be born! One constituency! One MP! One vast rolling field, rolling over everything, where lambs dance in the final frosts of springtime and fill the supermarkets by Easter! One of everything! One!</p><div><hr></div><h4>October 14th, 2022: Vince</h4><p>Across Europe, climate change protesters have started defacing works of art: they threw <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/14/just-stop-oil-activists-throw-soup-at-van-goghs-sunflowers">soup at a Van Gogh</a>, smeared <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/23/climate-activists-mashed-potato-monet-potsdam-germany">mashed potato over a Monet</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/27/girl-with-a-pearl-earring-vermeer-just-stop-oil-protest-mauritshuis-the-hague">glued themselves to a Vermeer.</a> ‘What is worth more: art or life? Are you more concerned about the protection of a painting or the protection of our planet and people?’ After all, if our planet really is doomed, then all the art goes with it.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> Why not start now? So the protesters set up a contradiction between <em>art</em> and <em>life</em>, and tell us that they are on the side of life. Fine—we’ve had iconoclasts before; it’s an ethos. But as an act of <em>effective</em> protest, this is almost entirely useless. </p><p>Even if art is less important than life, attacking art doesn’t necessarily make life any more viable. It’s an awareness-raising spectacle: make lots of noise, get your pictures in the paper, and people might start to feel that they really are in crisis… Doesn’t everyone already know? How much more awareness needs to be raised before that awareness starts transforming into results? I’m aware, but I still need to heat my home like everyone else. There <em>is</em> a form of climate activism that can effectively produce its desired results, and it’s the <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/3665-how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline">Andreas Malm</a> route. A stochastic campaign of sabotage and terrorism against fossil-fuel infrastructure, using homemade explosives, on a scale sufficient to manipulate the global energy markets and artificially reduce the relative cost of renewable options. But this year’s spike in oil prices has simulated what this might look like, and it looks like everyone getting poorer, except shareholders in energy companies. This would not make the activists particularly popular, so they’ve decided to not be activists at all.</p><p>The art vandalisms don’t make much sense as protest, but they do make sense <em>as art</em>. A performance, a theatre, an artwork commenting—like all contemporary art—on the fetishistic value of art itself. It is a little derivative; artists have been destroying each other’s works for some time now. There’s Robert Rauschenberg’s <em><a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/98.298/">Erased de Kooing Drawing</a></em>, Ai Weiwei’s <em><a href="https://www.guggenheim-bilbao.eus/en/learn/schools/teachers-guides/ai-weiwei-dropping-han-dynasty-urn-1995">Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn</a></em>, Jake and Dinos Chapman <a href="https://jakeanddinoschapman.com/works/injury-to-insult-to-injury/3444/">defacing Goya’s etchings</a>, and Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOxPYrdLD8Y">jumping on Tracey Emin’s bed</a>. It might have been better, more <em>real</em>, if these people had actually ruined something instead of only picking out those paintings protected behind glass. But the climate angle is nice, and its pedigree is sound; the Just Stop Oil protests are a perfectly legitimate work of art. Except—which is worth more? Art or life?</p><div><hr></div><h4>July 22nd, 2022: Sig</h4><p>Janan Ganesh <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ca72be9-18c8-4b9f-9dbe-27d97b9e63e6">writes</a> in the <em>Financial Times</em>:</p><blockquote><p>Most people’s ideological commitments are extraordinarily soft. What they think of as a belief is often a post-hoc rationalisation of a group loyalty. Crucially, this is more true, not less, of degree-holding, ‘high-information’ voters. What education can do is estrange people from parents and home town. It leaves them casting around for an alternative identity. Political tribe is as good as any. Why should someone who is pro-net zero also be pro-European Convention on Human Rights, well-disposed to Meghan Markle and squeamish about Dave Chappelle’s standup gigs? A clever progressive could find a philosophic thread that links those positions. But an honest one would admit to being carried along in the herd.</p></blockquote><p>Sigmund Freud writes in the <em>Three Essays</em>:</p><blockquote><p>A normal sexual life is only assured by an exact convergence of the two currents directed towards the sexual object and the sexual aim, the affectionate current and the sensual one. (The former, the affectionate current, comprises what remains over of the infantile efflorescence of sexuality.) It is like the completion of a tunnel which has been driven through a hill from both directions.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h4>July 7th, 2022: Boris</h4><p>We got rid of Boris Johnson because he was a <em>bad person</em>. And it’s true; he really is a bad person. If you were the type that likes to dole out diagnoses from a distance, you could probably call Boris a <em>psychopath</em>: very superficially charming, with all his fat-cheeked bluster, his posho pleonasm, that carefully contrived character he plays—but there’s something icy underneath, something lizardy and cruel. This is a man who believes in nothing except himself, and cares about nothing except power. In a previous age he might have been like his ancestors in the Ottoman aristocracy, slithering his way to the Sublime Porte on a path greased with blood. A dagger in his brother’s back, a harem full of murdered women and eunuchs, a drop of poison in the Sultan’s wine… But he lived in Britain in the twenty-first century, so his tools were different. For most of his life, he pretended to be an amiable, slightly scatterbrained upper-class buffoon. He had a particular talent for falling off bikes and into nearby bodies of water, crawling out of the pond slime with a wonky grin. </p><p>But every so often the mask would slip. In 2015, for instance, when he was on a junket to Japan as Mayor of London, invited to play a friendly game of rugby against some local schoolchildren. Someone passed him the ball; a touchdown was within reach, with just one skinny ten-year-old defender in the way… Johnson could have easily nipped around the child, but he didn’t; he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/15/boris-johnson-knocks-over-10-year-old-boy-during-rugby-game-in-japan">threw him to the ground</a> with one heave of his considerable Mayoral bulk. For a moment, he must have forgotten where he was and why he was there, forgotten that it’s not appropriate for elected officials to rugby-tackle a small child. The hunger took over, that old restless urge of the British ruling classes to dominate and destroy. The hordes of Asia break against his might! The Sun will never set again!</p><p>The longer Boris was in power, the lower that mask fell. You remember the scandals. How he was holding <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-59952395">boozy parties</a> while the law forbade everyone else from burying their parents. How he wouldn’t even say how many children he’d had with how many women. How one of his political allies had taken money from private companies and then illegally lobbied for their interests in Parliament, and how Boris had <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/no-johnson-apology-as-lobbying-furor-engulfs-his-u-k-government">responded</a> by simply trying to dissolve the Parliamentary Standards Committee. ‘<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45083275">Letter boxes</a>.’ <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnsons-50-lies-gaffes-26013022">Lies</a>. The thing about these scandals, though, is that none of them were particularly <em>political</em>; none of them had any effect on the way government interacts with the lives of its citizenry. They were pure perversion: we’re still in the vortex of his personality, his squalid magnetism. Nobody is thinking <em>politically</em>. </p><p>And in the end, when his own party turned on him and Boris fell, the TV and the newspapers had to pretend with a straight face that the entire political and economic direction of the country was about to change over the question of a <a href="https://www.cityam.com/downfall-of-a-prime-minister-how-handling-of-chris-pincher-scandal-spiralled-into-boris-johnsons-worst-crisis/">grabbed arse</a>.</p><p>All the nice liberal perverts were celebrating. Why? Did you think they’d let you have Keir Starmer? Did you forget that our next Prime Minister would be chosen by 170,000 of the country’s most retired colonels? Boris Johnson only cared about himself, which meant he was never particularly attached to the pieties of his own party, or even to the class project of British Conservatism. With Corbyn gone, he was the only major figure in British politics not wedded to the logic of austerity. Maybe this makes me a bad leftist, but I think that if you choose to care more about what government actually <em>does</em> than the moral character of the person leading it, this is important. Instead of depressing wages as an enticement to capital, which had long been unofficial Conservative policy, Boris used state investment to prop them up. Instead of starving the working classes into submission, he bought them off. He turned an instinctive Thatcherite like Rishi Sunak into the face of his new brand of Tory Keynesianism. Extraordinary promises: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1511ef22-201b-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b">£100 billion</a> for infrastructure, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/record-36-billion-investment-to-reform-nhs-and-social-care">£36 billion</a> for the NHS, even <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/communities-across-the-uk-can-bid-for-levelling-up-funds-to-save-pubs-clubs-and-historic-buildings">£150 million</a> to support community ownership of cultural institutions. Remember the summer of 2020? Remember Eat Out To Help Out? I do. The great weeknight feeding frenzy, descending on Soho for £10 off fancy broths and molluscs, the streets hot and thronged and perfumed, everyone dressed up sexy after a long lockdown alone, and all of it subsidised by <em>your</em> taxes… I was born under Thatcher; this was the first time any government policy ever directly <em>improved</em> my life.</p><p>Boris was a nihilist. And the people competing to replace him were mostly nihilists too; they just lack his imagination. They settle for the package of Default Governance in the twenty-first century, austerity plus antiwokeness. The faction that’s taken over the Labour party are the same: they can only promise that when <em>they</em> impose austerity, they’ll <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1584111727494447110">feel bad</a> about it. Look what you did! We had something, not the best we could hope for, but <em>something</em>, and you ruined it! You maniacs! You sick perverted freaks!</p><div><hr></div><h4>September 8th, 2022: Liz (HRH)</h4><p>‘All at <a href="https://twitter.com/BudBrewingUKI/status/1567985718399746048">Budweiser Brewing Group</a> UK&amp;I will observe the official mourning period.

We will not know their names.</p><div><hr></div><h4>October 20th, 2022: Liz (Rt Hon.)</h4><p>Liz Truss is the <em>lamest</em> person to have ever led a major nation in my lifetime, or possibly ever. Just the most all-encompassing herb, an unbearable HR lady who somehow go to write the Letters of Last Resort. Every public appearance is full of pure toe-curling autistic overenthusiasm. Every photo has her doing that utterly <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B6yjplhAr_t/">joyless</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BlQQy7Egbzx/">Hinge-profile</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8IhcKHpwW/">smirk</a>. She geeks out on Marvel movies, doggos, and BDSM. She’ll fall for you if you trip her. Her disastrous fifty-day premiership was the triumph of the mid.</p><p>People who’ve survived the ordeal tell me that being in Liz Truss’s presence for any period of time is a uniquely loathsome experience. The hairs on your arms stand up straight; you get the desperate, itchy, edgy sensation of absolutely <em>needing</em> a cigarette, but what you need is for <em>Liz Truss to stop talking</em>. And Liz Truss does not stop talking. She keeps saying things that are clearly not jokes and waiting expectantly for you to laugh, and when it gets too much to bear and you emit a noncommittal little <em>heh</em> she smiles and nods her head rapidly like a excitable puppy. Oh she’s so glad to be liked. In 1994, twenty years before she opened up those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxG8lzRA1ZA">new pork markets</a> in Beijing, there was her famous anti-monarchy speech to the Liberal Democrat conference. Liz Truss trying to do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOEwXHP8HI">audience engagement</a>. ‘We do not believe that people should be born to rule, or that they should put up or shut up about decisions that affect their lives. Do you, conference, believe that? Do you?’ The terrible, awkward silence of a few thousand Lib Dems squirming in their seats, trying to work out how this earnest nineteen-year-old is broadcasting directly to some primordial nub buried deep in the lizard brain, the one that’s currently screaming at them to <em>run</em>.</p><p>Liz Truss tried to implement the standard neoliberal package—tax cuts for the highest earners, privatisation, deregulation, cuts—and ended up being <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/imf-urges-truss-to-think-twice-before-going-forward-with-tax-cutting-plan/">censured by the IMF</a>. She was so slavishly devoted to the blank forces of finance capital that even the blank forces of finance capital found her weird and offputting. Is she really that awful? Or was this all some kind of <em>ploy</em>? The Adam Tooze theory <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/27/kwasi-kwarteng-cut-taxes-austerity">holds</a> that she deliberately crashed the pound to lock in austerity; the lefty joke goes that she’s a deep-cover socialist who killed the Queen, broke the back of British capital, and discredited the Tories for a generation. I have another reading. </p><p>Remember: Liz Truss is also a pervert. There was that <a href="https://popbitch.com/emails/the-slut-countdown/">blind item</a> supposedly about her, the one with the phrase ‘going in dry,’ but there is also the fact that she <a href="https://www.gawker.com/politics/does-liz-truss-wear-a-bdsm-day-collar">wears a day collar</a>. At home, the former Prime Minister crawls around with a leather strap around her neck, delivering Master’s newspaper with her teeth. It’s all there: she needs a <em>structure</em> in which her eagerness to please can be rewarded, and in which the instinctive human hatred of Liz Truss can be safely expressed. When she goes out, she symbolises her submission with a discreet necklace, the same one she seems to wear every single day. She is deep in the lifestyle; her collar <em>never comes off</em>. So why wouldn’t it affect her decisions in office? Does she have a humiliation fetish? Have we all been conscripted, without our knowledge, into the most intense <em>scene</em> in kink history? Slave girl DOMINATED and PUNISHED by Daddy Bond Markets. Vulnerable 47 year old left RUINED and DISGRACED after being publicly SCREWED by 364 colleagues. POUNDED by the pound. SPREAD OPEN by Gilt/Bund spreads. The bond markets now openly govern Britain, and this is her legacy. PM Rishi Sunak’s role is simply to transform their signals into policy. But Liz Truss discovered that the entire system of global governance can be transformed, if you want it, into the mechanism of a secret delight.</p><div><hr></div><h4>August 3rd, 251,898,702 BC: Liz (ard)</h4><p>Tiny crystalline lizards dart newborn off their cliffsides and fall flocking spinning into the sea. Fall on gossamer webs from leg to leg. Liz Truss (as a tiny crystalline lizard) watches them leave. Down there in the speckled sea are flecks and foam as tiny lizards stab into shoals of glinting quicksilver fish. She will not swoop. Her pleasures are richer than that. Hooking her claws into the wet cliffs she climbs. Doing things wrong but feeling right. Maybe she will find some unhatched broods up here, the eggs of her siblings, and eat. Maybe she will head inland, deep into desert Pangea, where paleodictyopteroids flap in the baking heat. The first pervert. She does not know it, but the Permian era is ending, and almost everything that lives will soon be dead. But not her. A time of great monsters has arrived.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Debase yourself</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>The other one is Disraeli.

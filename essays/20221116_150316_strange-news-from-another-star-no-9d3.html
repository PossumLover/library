My subscriber count has nearly doubled since <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/strange-news-from-another-star-no">the first instalment</a>, so a recap: </em>Strange News from Another Star<em> is a kind of collective dream journal, based on the suspicion that dreams—even other people’s—are more important, and more interesting, than conventional wisdom would have you believe. Each month, I hope to dig into some specific aspect of dreaming: the themes that crop up again and again, the mechanics of it all, or scraps from the history of oneirocriticism. Last month’s edition was about the relation between dreams and the waking world; this month’s is about death.</em></p><p><em>SNAS No. 3 will be about dreams and messages. In basically every human society, (some) dreams were thought to be messages: communications from the spirit world, or the gods, or God, or even from other living people plugged in to the great communications network of sleep. I am interested in dreams that seemed to be unambiguously </em>telling you something<em> (Tony Soprano with his fish), and dreams that turned out to be in some way prophetic—but I’m also interested in messages </em>within<em> dreams. In my own dreams, I’ve received important-seeming information in emails, letters, through a kind of steampunk fax machine, and coded into a receipt. In one, I kept receiving handwritten notes telling me that I had ‘now become truly obese.’ In another, an international Ponzi scheme somehow revolved around a single quote in a collection of Henry Kissinger’s aphorisms, in which he said of the Donbass: ‘We need that coal. And, I’m told, the dream of human freedom is incomplete without Luhansk.’ I once dreamed that the ingredients list on a bottle of shampoo contained an urgent message from my brother informing me that our entire family was directly descended from Hitler. And so on.</em></p><p><em>If you’ve had an interesting message in a dream (or just an interesting dream), I’d like to hear about it, and apparently there are thousands of other people who would too.

The piece is basically an attempt to communicate some of the terror of mortality to people who think they are immortal, but I also suspect that some people simply are afraid of death and others aren’t, and whether or not you believe there’s anything nice on the other side has basically no bearing on it.</em></p></li><li><p><em>For Justin EH Smith’s Substack, I wrote about <a href="https://justinehsmith.substack.com/p/the-roaring-of-things-a-guest-essay">the Tarot</a>.

I find it hard to imagine that there’s anyone who’s interested in what I’m doing here who doesn’t already read Justin, but if you don’t, then <a href="https://justinehsmith.substack.com/">go now</a>, go and subscribe at once.</em></p></li><li><p><em>I wrote two features I’m quite proud of for the </em>Spectator<em>, one on <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-I-admire-saudi-arabia-s-monstrous-new-city">The Line</a>, the utterly nightmarish linear city being built in Saudi Arabia, which I admire despite all my better instincts, and one on <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/war-games-do-something-seriously-unpleasant-to-our-brains/">videogames and war</a>, which are both terrible evils that any future socialist order must wipe off the face of the earth.</em></p></li><li><p><em>For </em>The Point<em>, I wrote about <a href="https://thepointmag.com/criticism/when-reason-fails/">the literature of mass shootings</a>—specifically, the question of why there isn’t any. What really makes the United States unique is not that this is a society that murders its children, but that these murders can happen and mainstream literary culture has </em>nothing to say<em> about it.

On into the night.</em></p><h4>Dream of the month</h4><p><a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/strange-news-from-another-star-no">Last month</a>, I asked if any of you had any interesting dreams, and you did. I was basically overwhelmed by a glut of deeply weird stories, some of which are relevant to this month’s topic, and some which aren’t. If you are in the latter group, remain calm. I am holding onto your dreams, and I fully intend to publish them when the time is right. However, there was one from the last month that was strange enough that I wanted to share it right away, so I may as well institutionalise the process. The first <em>SNAS</em> dream of the month is from Brendan:</p><blockquote><p>I was at a big open-air market in China. At one point I walked by a vendor, an old woman, selling beauty products. She tried to get me to come into her stall to sample some things and I initially resisted, but eventually, sheepishly, went in. She started showing me all of her lotions and perfumes and powders and finally, she pulled out a huge red vat of what looked like vegetable shortening. She went on to explain that it was meant to be applied inside your foreskin, and that my girlfriend would love it because it would make me taste better when she went down on me. She asked if I wanted to try a sample and I said no, but at this point there was a crowd gathering around the stall and no way for me to leave. She put on a pair of blue latex gloves (not the kind a doctor wears, but the kind a mechanic wears—dark blue, very thick) and I let her pull my pants down. My foreskin was the size of a Pringles can, which seemed natural and not surprising to anyone. She then proceeded to take handfuls of this Crisco-looking stuff and slather a thick layer of it onto the inside surface of my massive foreskin, which had a red, puffy, brain-like texture. When she was done I pulled my pants back up and left.</p></blockquote><p>There’s a lot to dive into here, but I think what really makes this dream is the final sentence. A crowd has assembled to ominously demand that our dreamer let someone interfere with his genitals. Everything is big: the huge vat, the huge swollen foreskin, the hugeness of China. Big things are important. Our dreamer resists it all the way, from the second the old woman invites him into her stall; he is a consistently unwilling participant in his own dream. But then the terrible event happens and he just carries on. ‘I have no idea what to make of it,’ Brendan says. Me neither. The dream does contain a sequence of things that are eaten but which are not, strictly speaking, food: seed oils, Pringles, cum. But what does it mean to compare a penis to a <em>brain</em>? Crackpot interpretations welcomed.</p><h4>1. If you die in the dream you die in real life</h4><p>Well, actually, if you die in a dream, you <em>wake up</em>.</p><p>You people seem to have been dying a lot. Maybe the kind of person who’d subscribe to me is particularly anxious or macabre; maybe everyone is like this. Many of you were dying in plane crashes: one anonymous reader over the African savannah, one over Ukraine, one over London ‘but it was clearly made of cardboard,’ and one in ‘a forested region I knew was on another planet.’ <em>Two</em> of you have died on board planes crashing into your childhood homes. Despite the fact that they’re far more deadly, you did not appear to be dying in road accidents: I got a few stories about cars, but none of them were fatal for the dreamer. Death has a shape, and it looks like commercial air travel.</p><p>Aside from plane crashes, other mass-casualty events predominate. Nuclear war, tidal waves; the dream is a disaster zone. Last month I collected some disaster-dreams from my friends, and mentioned one who died when another planet collided with the Earth; I heard from several more of you that you’d had dreams of a similar nature. Among the comet impacts there was one I particularly liked, from Georgie:</p><blockquote><p>I also dreamed about a meteorite, but in my dream Earth was being ‘chased’ by the meteor, so sometimes it was bigger in the sky and sometimes we could outrun it. My husband and I were on vacation in a beach hut on a tropical island with shimmering, lightly iridescent waters, a bit like an oil slick but all in various shades of baby blue. You could wade out for miles and the water wouldn’t come up further than your knees. As part of the global effort to outrun the comet we had to sprint through the surf every morning, but I kept stopping to look down at all the beautiful multicoloured fish and coral reefs, and every time the comet was getting bigger. My husband was grabbing my wrist, telling me to keep running, because ‘the fish will survive either way,’ but the fish were dancing provocatively around my feet and whispering ‘look at me, look at me, look what I can do.’ They told me they had a gift for me, and when I stopped the comet caught up with us and we died.</p></blockquote><p>What does all this mean? According to a website called DreamChrist, ‘when you dream about meteors and the end of the world, this is a sign that you will face a lot of success due to your hard work. You are moving towards a new beginning and leaving the past behind.’ This seems tenuous. According to another website called DreamBible, ‘to dream of an asteroid coming towards the earth represents a potential problem.’ This is more plausible, but it’s not exactly a novel insight. DreamGlossary, meanwhile, suggests that ‘if you are dreaming of a meteorite hitting you, it means you will fall in love.’ Can we do better? David suggests that these dreams might be a product of your media diet:</p><blockquote><p>As part of my job, I am required to log in to different corporate Twitter accounts, and am always struck by the different worlds that are presented to me. In my personal account, I am presented with memes, puns and cum jokes. On corporate/academic Twitter I am in a different universe. Threads from Serious Epidemiologists about how COVID is coming back to kill us all this December. Suggested news stories in the sidebar inform me it is also too late to stop climate change, 70% of animal species are already dead, and Putin plans to nuke us into oblivion any second now. Is it any wonder, then, that one of my colleagues, who lives only in the latter online universe, told me she dreams of nuclear apocalypse regularly? Of great tsunamis washing us all away?</p></blockquote><p>But while these dreams <em>look</em> like fear, and the liberal-neurotic dreamer might <em>interpret</em> them as fear, I’m not so sure. </p><p>In Bruno Schulz’s short story <em>The Comet</em>, the asteroid impact isn’t just something that comes to annihilate humanity; it’s the crowning <em>achievement</em> of ‘the age of electricity and mechanics and a whole swarm of inventions.’ This is ‘the most progressive, freethinking end of the world imaginable, in line with the spirit of the times.’ But eventually the comet becomes just slightly passé—’fashion overtook by a nose and outstripped the indefatigable bolide’—and instead of colliding, the now-unhip comet simply roars through the sky and off again into space. Everyone is incredibly disappointed: now they are condemned to live. In dreams, too, these mass deaths can be shot through with desire. My friend <a href="https://ninapower.substack.com/">Nina Power</a> dreamed that she was killed in a nuclear apocalypse with all her ex-boyfriends. She still has warm feelings for these people, and the experience felt oddly peaceful, the atomic bombs burning like a beautiful sunset. Death comes like the end of a good relationship or the end of a good day. A gentle, grateful fiery end of the world.</p><p>Maybe we need Blanchot. ‘The disaster is the time when one can no longer—by desire, ruse, or violence—risk the life which one seeks, through this risk, to prolong. It is the time when the negative falls silent and when in place of men comes the infinite calm which does not embody itself or make itself intelligible.’</p><p>Other than that, there was no particular pattern to the ways in which you’ve been dying. One anonymous reader died when ‘a bunch of holes started opening up on the sidewalk. They were like the pits in Super Mario, full of spikes, and all the children on the street were jumping into them, so I thought I may as well follow them.’ Another saw fit to send this email:</p><blockquote><p>Call me Matt. I was out hiking and got crushed to death by a herd of reindeer coming like an avalanche down the hillside. Woke up feeling weirdly great? Love the stack.</p></blockquote><p>Speaking of animals, Jessica reports the following dream, which reads like something out of Kafka:</p><blockquote><p>An unusually vivid dream last week where I was in a cattle stockade in 1920s Chicago. (I’m Irish, and have never been to the US.) I was trapped in there with hundreds of angry bulls; on one side workers were leading the cattle one by one into an abattoir, but before they could go in there was a judge who had to pass a sentence of death on each bull for their various crimes. (Mostly murder and blasphemy.) When it was my turn they made me stand on the conveyor belt and I kept protesting my innocence, but the judge just looked bored. He told me I could appeal the decision later if I wanted. Then the conveyor belt carried me into the dark doorway to be slaughtered and I woke up. </p></blockquote><p>My girlfriend dreamed she was being euthanised by David Lynch in an ice rink. He was very gentle about it, administering the lethal objection, and it was far too late for her to register any objections. As she slipped into death everything faded to black, and then she woke up.</p><p>Why <em>do</em> we wake up after dying in a dream? As far as I can tell, the scientific hypothesis is that imagining yourself dying is a stressful experience, stressful experiences cause the release of adrenaline, and adrenaline wakes you up. I do not believe this for a second. Firstly, because not all of the dreams about dying you’ve sent in seem to be particularly stressful. Secondly, because among those dreams that <em>are</em> unpleasant, the most stressful moment often comes <em>before</em> the actual moment of death, when you realise there’s no escape—but you only wake up once you’ve actually died. Thirdly, because if stress alone could wake you up, nobody would ever have nightmares.</p><p>So much for neuroscience. I think psychoanalysis might have the germ of a better answer. </p><p>‘In analysis,’ Freud tells us, ‘we never discover a ‘no’ in the unconscious.’ The world of the unconscious is brighter and clearer than the world of the waking mind; everything that exists there exists fully, is simply <em>present</em>. As it happens, you can see this very easily in dreams: Matthew Spellberg, who I mentioned last time, points out that in a dream there is ‘no contemplation at a distance;’ as soon as you conceive of something, it’s immediately <em>there</em>. You can’ have a dream in which you’re thinking about a sandwich without the sandwich itself becoming perceptible. You certainly can’t have a dream about the <em>absence</em> of a sandwich. ‘Thoughts are experienced as reality.’ Because the unconscious does not know negation, everything repressed by the conscious mind ends up down there, where nothing ever vanishes. The whole work of analysis consists of dredging stuff <em>up</em> from the unconscious and into the open air where it can be taken apart. </p><p>But death is a special case. Death can <em>never</em> be subjectively <em>there</em>: it’s a huge inconceivable negation that can <em>only</em> be contemplated at a distance, since in its actual presence you yourself simply vanish. Freud again: ‘No one believes in his own death, or, to put the same thing in another way, in the unconscious every one of us is convinced of his own immortality.’ Death cannot be represented in the unconscious. This is why Julia Kristeva writes that the death drive does not, properly speaking, exist: there is only a ‘hiatus, blank, or spacing’ that gives cadence to the unconscious and its contents.</p><p>For Freud, dreams are first and foremost ‘the guardians of sleep and not its disturbers,’ and this is why every dream is also the expression of a desire. If there’s something you want, it’s presented to you in your dreams, so that instead of getting up and doing things you stay blissfully asleep. But when dreams have to represent death, which they are incapable of representing, they run into a contradiction. The whole system shuts down, like a calculator when you try to divide by zero. The dream stops working, sleep is left unguarded, and you wake up.</p><p>But we don’t always wake up immediately after dying in a dream. Last time, I wrote about a dream in which I died, but then had to carry on:</p><blockquote><p>Once I was in a plane crash near the house where I grew up. Afterwards, I had to phone my mum and get her to pick me up in her car. She was very disappointed in me for having died. ‘We never thought you’d be the type to do that sort of thing.’ I lit a cigarette, and she told me she didn’t like me smoking. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘it hardly matters now.’</p></blockquote><p>None of you experienced anything similar, but I did get one response that talked about a kind of interregnum between dying in a dream and waking up:</p><blockquote><p>I’ve also died in a dream without waking up. Earlier this year I had a dream in which I was at my son’s friend’s birthday party (he’s four). They were playing a game called Poison Cup; I drank from the poison cup and keeled over immediately. I wasn’t remotely surprised; I just thought, well, I’ve died, but I’m still here, so obviously that was a dream. I’m pretty sure I was thinking consciously but I couldn’t wake up. I don’t think it was sleep paralysis exactly, I wasn’t in my bed, but I also didn’t have any auditory or visual hallucinations. It wasn’t even like my field of vision went black, there were no sensory inputs at all. I was just… nowhere. This lasted for about ten minutes, in which I was mostly convinced I’d been dreaming but still partway open to the idea that I’d actually died and this is what it’s like afterwards, just a consciousness alone in the void. When I woke up fully I didn’t even remember the dream at first, but then I was checking the news on my phone about Ukraine and I told my wife ‘oh yeah, I forgot I was dead.’ She was a bit freaked out.</p></blockquote><p>Maybe the most fascinating story I received, though, was from an anonymous reader who actually went through a near death experience:</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><blockquote><p>Not sure if this counts but I nearly died when I was 22. I had a ruptured appendix and it all happened incredibly quickly: in the morning I was fine, that night I was in intensive care with septic shock and multiorgan failure. I remember lying in the hospital with the doctors rushing around me, I understood very clearly that I was dying but I wanted to tell them that they could stop worrying, it was fine, everything was completely fine. I didn’t experience tunnel vision or see a bright light or Jesus or dead relatives or whatever, I just felt completely chill and accepting of everything. I made it through (obviously) and I’m ok now, but ever since then I’ve had genuinely no fear of death. I know that dying is beautiful and doesn’t hurt. I haven’t had any dreams where I’m dying but since then I have had a few about hospitals. In the last one I can remember I was having a big meal with my friends on long trestle tables in a hospital corridor. We were all eating chili out these heavy plastic sacks and the light was bright and warm and it felt a bit like dying, everything felt great.</p></blockquote><h4>2. Where the worm dieth not</h4><p>Let’s accept, for the moment, that in the unconscious, and therefore in dreams, death <em>itself</em> does not exist. What this means, then, is that dreams are <em>where the dead still live</em>. In other words, an underworld.</p><p>This is the theory that the rogue Jungian James Hillman spent most of his life promoting. ‘It is no secret that dreams belong to the underworld and its gods.’ Where Freud (and also Jung) went wrong, he writes, was in trying to translate dreams into the language of the dayworld. ‘We turn the light on them in the morning, take them to the typewriter, bring them to the analyst, and together we read hem for messages about living situations.’ But these things belong to their own world, which is Hades:</p><blockquote><p>When we consider the House of Hades, we must remember that the myths—and Freud too—tell us that there is no time in the underworld. There is no decay, no progress, no change of any sort. Because time has nothing to do with the underworld, we may not conceive the underworld as ‘after’ life, except as the afterthoughts within life.</p></blockquote><p>The underworld is a <em>structure</em>, a viewpoint, a way of ordering things that follows entirely different rules to the dayworld. Still, it might contain important secrets. Hades is ‘identical with Zeus <em>chthonios</em>,’ suggesting that ‘upper and lower worlds are the same; only the perspectives differ.’ In that vein, a reader passes along a passage from Ursula K Le Guin’s <em>The Tombs of Atuan</em>, in which the underworld reveals itself in a dream:</p><blockquote><p>It was late, and she went straight to the&nbsp;Small House to bed. In the night she woke suddenly; she remembered that she had left her cloak in the Painted Room. He would have nothing for warmth in that dank vault but his own short cloak, no bed but the dusty stone. A cold grave, a cold grave, she thought miserably, but she was too weary to wake up fully, and soon slipped back into sleep. She began to dream. She dreamt of the souls of the dead on the walls of the Painted Room, the figures like great bedraggled birds with human hands and feet and faces, squatting in the dust of the dark places. They could not fly. Clay was their food and dust their drink. They were the souls of those not reborn, the ancient peoples and the unbelievers, those whom the Nameless Ones devoured. They squatted all around her in the shadows, and a faint creaking or cheeping sound came from them now and then. One of them came up quite close to her. She was afraid at first and tried to draw away, but could not move. This one had the face of a bird, not a human face; but its hair was golden, and it said in, a woman's voice, ‘Tenar,’ tenderly, softly, ‘Tenar.’</p></blockquote><p>Tenar’s name was taken from her by the priests of the Nameless Ones; it is returned to her by the dead. After waking, ‘she shook with cold, and terror, and exultation, there under the open, sunwashed sky. ‘I have my name back. I am Tenar!’’</p><p>There’s a kind of eerie echo between Le Guin’s fictional dream and one sent in to me by the writer <a href="https://www.pdfranz.com/writing">Paul Franz</a>. Paul describes a dream set in a network of underground catacombs, like ‘a church or a museum,’ low galleries covered in gold leaf. A group of people is moving through these galleries, slowly, reverentially. The walls are decorated with photographs and frescoes of a woman:</p><blockquote><p>A distinct person, though not anyone I knew from previous, waking life. She was possibly in her forties, neither old nor young, with yellow-blond hair flaring out of either side of her head, and with a placid, settled, determined expression that did not prompt or suggest either desire or anything maternal. The face also contained a certain warmth. It was not unfriendly, not stern; it was a beautiful face; simply absorbed in its own purposes. There was something Soviet about her demeanour, that same self-possession one finds in Soviet women.</p></blockquote><p>In some of these images, she’s wearing a suit of medieval armour; in others, a clerical collar. These images are linked by markings, waves or dotted lines, ‘with patterns sort of like Keith Haring’s, or Australian glyph art.’ Eventually, Paul finds himself in another chamber in this dense underground world, a high green atrium, and he discovers what’s going on:</p><blockquote><p>This was a memorial service, and the person being commemorated was the woman whose images we had seen lining the walls, and who was the priest of this establishment, whatever it was. She had recently died. And though she herself was religious, the ceremony was not a religious one. It appeared that this woman had been some kind of a teacher, and those gathered here were her students… High up on the green wall I could see a painted scroll, on which were written some words in Greek. I tried to make them out, but couldn’t. Then I woke up.</p></blockquote><p>We could count the similarities. Golden hair, painted images, catacombs, and a message: because like the soul in Le Guin’s novel, this woman has a gift. Paul writes that when he woke, he started describing the dream to his wife in detail. ‘All of this was connected for me, somehow, with our talk of having a child. Something in me that had previously obstructed such considerations had been lightened, transfigured. As if, now, it would be possible to have a child. It would be ok to.’</p><p>For Hillman, the people we encounter in dreams are not simply images of the ‘real’ people we know, as Freud assumes. They are also not, as Jung has it, aspects of the self. ‘They are personae, masks, in the hollow of which is a <em>numen</em>. The god or <em>eidolon</em> appears to the dreamer in the guise of a living friend… My brother with whom I worry about my father’s business in a dream is neither my actual objective brother nor the older, sombre, responsible traits that slow and weigh me down. My dream-brother, because he is now a shade in the underworld, is an <em>eidola</em>, a purely psychic form.’ The dead woman in Paul Franz’s dream is very clearly some kind of god. But what about the people we encounter in dream who have made the underworld their home, and who <em>no longer exist</em> under the sun? What does it mean to dream about the dead?</p><p>Hillman repeatedly refers to Odysseus’s <em>catabasis</em>, his descent into the underworld. But the distinction between real (dead) people and <em>eidola</em> isn’t entirely clear. In one of the epic’s most heartbreaking moments, Odysseus discovers that one of his companions, poor young hopeful Elpenor, has travelled there by different means. On the morning they set off to sail for Hades, Elpenor slipped from a roof and died. The others didn’t even notice; they were too busy preparing for their voyage. Now, they’re surprised to see him. ‘How did you come here, to the land of shadows? You have been quicker on foot than I in my black ship.’ Elpenor has to explain that he is one of the dead now, and he will not be leaving with them. He begs Odysseus to find his corpse and give it a proper funeral on his return to the world of the living. ‘Burn my body there with all the arms I possess, and raise a mound for me on the shore of the grey sea, in memory of an unlucky man.’</p><p>But Homer also gives us an instance of communication with the dead <em>through dreams</em>. In the <em>Iliad</em>, Achilles has a dream-vision of dead Patroclus, his friend and lover. Like Elpenor, Patroclus asks for a funeral. ‘You are asleep, and you have forgotten me, Achilles. You were never neglectful of me while I lived, but you are in my death.’ Achilles promises he will honour his request, but he’s also glad to see him again, and seems slightly miffed that Patroclus is so keen to pass through the gates of Hades. ‘Stand closer to me now: let us embrace each other, if only for a short while, and have our pleasure in the sorrow of tears.’ They can’t. ‘The ghost vanished away under the earth like smoke.’ But Achilles leaves us with a strange image. ‘All night long,’ he tells the Myrmidons afterwards, ‘the ghost of Patroclus has stood over me weeping.’ It’s the <em>living</em> who lie down, motionless, 'in a clear place, where the waves wash up on the beach,’ while the dead stand over them and mourn. </p><p>Dreams of the dead are called <em>visitation dreams</em>. Here’s one, submitted by Brooke: </p><blockquote><p>My father died in a horrible car accident when I was 19. Only seven years later did I begin to dream of him. Now he appears to me on occasion, grey-green skinned, face distorted by injury, his right cheek bone crushed, obscuring his right eye. It is him, but not him. He tells me that he has returned to me for one day, and to not get too attached to his being here, and then turns and leaves, to go and wait in a house that is like my childhood home and positioned on the edge of the dreamworld. I follow him there, and he lays on the couch like he used to, and doesn't say a lot, and I simply look at him. When sunset comes, he leaves the house, and passes over a bridge that for some reason I find myself being unable to step onto, and literally walks off into the sunset. I find myself waking up glad to have ‘seen’ him again, despite knowing logically that I did not.</p></blockquote><p>Many, many societies have taken visitation dreams seriously. (Spellberg again: ‘In many Australian cultures death doesn’t truly occur until a person is sighted one last time in a dream.’) But not mine. There’s a story from the Talmud, in which a man’s dead father appears to him in a dream and reveals the location of his hidden money. The man finds the stash, and uses the dream as evidence that he should be its rightful inheritor. The rabbis aren’t convinced. ‘What is said in dreams does not weigh in either direction.’ Judaism is deeply <em>suspicious</em> of all this stuff. In the Bible, King Saul risks God’s punishment by consulting a necromancer, the Witch of Endor, to speak with the ghost of Samuel. She raises his spirit, and then cries out in terror. Saul asks what she’s seen. ‘I saw gods ascending out of the earth.’</p><p>For his impiety, God curses Saul to die. But I didn’t heed the lesson: I have also been a necromancer.</p><p>My <a href="https://samkriss.com/2018/11/08/there-she-goes/">closest friend died</a> in 2018. In the first weeks and months, it was unbearable: I could still hear her voice in my head, still summon her face: this person was still <em>alive</em> to me, and her death felt like a very nasty prank. I kept thinking of things I wanted to say to her, small funny banal things, and I simply could not accept that there was nobody there to hear them. (Some of her other friends kept texting her number for months after she died, just to chat.) But later, as I went through the long slow work of mourning, she started to fade away, and that was <em>worse</em>. Nothing is as monstrous as healing. These days, it’s so much harder to imagine her voice, her face, or her laugh. She’s gone fuzzy at the edges. But not in dreams, because in dreams nothing dies. In dreams, she’s exactly as she was, exactly as I can no longer quite remember her.</p><p>I wanted to keep seeing her, so for a while I tried dream incubation. Before going to sleep, I would look at photos of her, watch old videos from when we were both alive, and hope she’d visit me in the night. (She’d promised, once, that if she died before I did she would return to haunt me, so we could keep hanging out.) And sometimes it worked, but like Samuel’s vision of Saul, these visions came with curses. In one, we were on a skiing holiday together, but all I could do was tell her that she would live, I was sure of it, she could come back and live. I woke feeling worse than ever. In another, we were trying to watch <em>Shrek 2</em> in a slightly manky basement flat in Ealing. ‘I can’t concentrate on this,’ she said. ‘I’m dead.’ She did not appear to be at peace. Maybe she, like Elpenor and Patroclus, was asking to be buried. I stopped trying to summon her after that.</p><p>But last month, I saw her again. I dreamed I was visiting the Whitney in New York and ran into her in the queue outside. She looked a little different: her hair was darker and she’d cut it short; her face had aged. She was lightly surprised to see me, but she asked politely how I’d been. She said she was doing a PhD at the National Institute for the Prevention of Pedantry in Denver, and was just dropping into New York for some research. Clearly I looked like I had a lot to get off my chest, because she sighed and suggested we ‘do this’ over a drink. We walked to a bar, and she was still talking normally until we sat down, at which point I rounded on her. ‘You know we all thought you were dead? We had a funeral! I <em>grieved</em> for you. I wrote a <em>eulogy</em> for you!’ I was furious. She just laughed. ‘Yeah,’ she said, ‘I read that thing. It was a bit over the top, wasn’t it?’</p><p>I had that dream exactly four years to the day after she died. I hadn’t realised; I was always bad at remembering her birthday too. But it was good to see her. She seemed happy. She seemed well. </p><h4>3. Grind it, knead it</h4><p>The other great link between dreams and the underworld is the <em>prophetic</em> dream, the one that presages death. Anna Ballan sends this passage from Tolstoy’s <em>Anna Karenina</em>. ‘I will die,’ Anna tells Vronsky. ‘I had a dream’:</p><blockquote><p>‘I dreamed that I ran into my bedroom, that I had to get something there, to find something out—you know how it happens in dreams,’ she said, her eyes wide with horror, ‘and there was something standing in the bedroom, in the corner. And this something turned, and I saw it was a muzhik with a dishevelled beard,&nbsp;small and frightening. I wanted to run away, but he bent over a sack and rummaged in it with his hands…’ And she showed how he rummaged in the sack. There was horror in her face. And Vronsky… felt the same horror filling his soul… ‘He rummages and mutters in French, very quickly, and rolling the <em>r</em>s in his throat, you know: ‘<em>Il faut le battre le fer, le broyer, le peátrir</em>…’’</p></blockquote><p>Anna (Ballan, not Karenina) comments:</p><blockquote><p>The shadowy figure transforms from a nameless, uncanny ‘something’ into a disgusting, Gregor Samsa-esque creepy crawler, only the vermin here is&nbsp;<em>speaking French</em>—often something aristocrats did to hide conversations from their peasants, I gather. Is Anna&nbsp;scared, basically, by the blurring of class boundaries—or is it the blurring of boundaries more generally that’s&nbsp;the essence of the uncanny? The nightmare reappears almost 400 pages later, again as death has ‘presented itself to her clearly and vividly as the only way to restore the love for her in [Vronsky’s] heart, to punish him and to be victorious…’ (ah, Anna!).&nbsp;The dream has basically the same narrative structure as before: she sees that ‘a little old muzhik with a dishevelled beard was doing something,’ but the French words have now becoming ‘meaningless,’ unintelligible, gibberish, further obscuring and mystifying the encounter.</p><p>Later, incredibly, Tolstoy actually plays out this vision in waking life. On her final train ride Anna spots ‘a dirty, ugly muzhik in a peaked cap, his matted hair sticking out from under it, passed by the window, bending down to the wheels of the carriage.’&nbsp;Then: ‘‘There’s something familiar about that hideous muzhik,’ thought Anna. And recalling her dream, she stepped away to the opposite door, trembling with fear.’ Is Anna hallucinating, seeing nightmares around every corner? It seems not, in fact; the&nbsp;dream is shown rather mystically to <em>come true</em>: after Anna’s body has gone under, ‘feeling the impossibility of any struggle,’ we read the following sentence, objective and bare: ‘A little muzhik, muttering to himself, was working over some iron.’&nbsp;</p><p>Is Tolstoy exacting upon Anna some sort of revenge?&nbsp;In a Freudian reading of the dream sequence, Anna’s preoccupation with the figure of the muzhik functions as a return of a repressed unconscious: she feels guilt about abandoning a hypothetical patriarchal peasant morality, let’s say, and embracing a decadent metropolitan existence—an existence untethered to the land, an existence straight out of vulgar French adultery novels. Her disconnect from the soil (and its environs, traditions, and virtues) haunts her dream life and ultimately kills her.</p></blockquote><p>Maybe I have too much Hillman in my head right now, but I don’t think it detracts from this very erudite analysis to also see the muzhik as something else: a psychopomp, a dream-guide into the underworld. This vague shape, this <em>eidolon</em>, this hazy spirit muttering aristocratic French, this obliteration of all boundaries, this creature of the soil, working iron, the bowels of the earth, the ground where the dead return…</p><p>There are more death-symbols in this dream from an anonymous reader:</p><blockquote><p>In the night a crow tapped on my window. I let it in and it stepped onto my back and began sort of tapping me and sounding me out. Erin told me not to move. It then started tying a thin black thread around my finger into a sort of ring. Erin was very excited and told me this meant he had chosen me and we were now bonded for life.&nbsp;</p><p>A little while later, outside, I discovered the crow had butchered a group of wild turkeys for me and left them in a bloody heap on my porch. I admonished him and his blood soaked beak. His eyes seemed to say ‘but you hate these turkeys.’&nbsp;</p><p>When I tried to distance myself from his actions he told me (telepathically) of the pact made between the Irish hero Seamus and God. Seamus had promised God he would climb a certain tower; privately he had said to someone else that he had no intention of actually doing so. But the ‘nine listeners’ overheard, and told God that Seamus would prove untrue, and to this day the Irish people shave their heads to keep their hair under a certain height so as not to be noticed by God.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, one more of my own, about the deaths of <em>other people</em>. I dreamed I was visiting a dusty second-hand charity bookshop; the charity in question was a hospice. Here, the dying lay on bunk beds, and all their old books and personal possessions were piled up underneath. By selling their stuff, they could cover the costs of their palliative care; the place had forced them all into being deathbed entrepreneurs. One of the dying patients was surprisingly young, and he pointed out a copy of an Umberto Eco novel I hadn’t read. Between his coughing fits, he urged me to buy it, telling me it was Eco’s masterpiece and that I’d really love it; he hoped it would be as special to me as it had been for him. I didn’t buy the thing; instead, I stole it. I slipped it into the inside pocket of my coat when he wasn’t looking, walked straight out, and woke with overwhelming guilt.</p><div><hr></div><p>As I said at the start, the next edition of <em>Strange News from Another Star</em> will be about messages.

Most of them are boring and a few are clearly made up, but some of them seem just strange enough to be real, and most of those are the ones with words in them:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ad5c26-1068-4816-9767-309a63461ba4_474x284.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ad5c26-1068-4816-9767-309a63461ba4_474x284.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ad5c26-1068-4816-9767-309a63461ba4_474x284.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ad5c26-1068-4816-9767-309a63461ba4_474x284.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ad5c26-1068-4816-9767-309a63461ba4_474x284.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ad5c26-1068-4816-9767-309a63461ba4_474x284.png" width="474" height="284" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b1ad5c26-1068-4816-9767-309a63461ba4_474x284.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:284,&quot;width&quot;:474,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:9500,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ad5c26-1068-4816-9767-309a63461ba4_474x284.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ad5c26-1068-4816-9767-309a63461ba4_474x284.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ad5c26-1068-4816-9767-309a63461ba4_474x284.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ad5c26-1068-4816-9767-309a63461ba4_474x284.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">u/TheTrueTuck</figcaption></figure></div><p>Thanks to everyone for your submissions, and please keep them coming.

I have no firm political principles and no meaningful ethics. There’s a hole in my brain where those things ought to be, slowly filling with a greasy, cloudy-white fluid, and every so often I need to go to the hospital to have it drained. What I <em>do</em> have is a ravenous, zombielike compulsion to say the precise opposite of what everyone else is saying. I will like absolutely any kind of nonsense until it becomes popular, at which point I will savagely turn against it. I will believe in any idea so long as it’s annoying. I can dress this up in fancy arguments, but at base it’s all purely instinctive; it probably has something to do with my childhood. Sometimes people share the things I say online, because they agree with them, and they want other people to agree with them too. Sometimes they choose to disagree instead, and they come up with arguments about why I’m wrong. This is insane behaviour. You might as well decide to start agreeing or disagreeing with a magic 8-ball, or a stopped clock, or the moon.</p><p>Because I am a contrarian, I was absolutely delighted to hear that the most recent editions of Roald Dahl’s much-beloved children’s books have been tweaked and trimmed hundreds of times to bring them more into line with contemporary sensibilities. So Matilda now reads Jane Austen instead of Joseph Conrad, and her mother is no longer too exhausted after a day of bingo to cook the family its evening meal. In <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>, Veruca Salt no longer ‘wants a good kick in the pants;’ she ‘needs to learn some manners.’ The flea powder in <em>George’s Marvellous Medicine</em> will no longer, if eaten, make your dog explode; instead, the dog will merely ‘hop like a flea.’ The grandmother in <em>The Witches</em> no longer says that ‘you can’t go round pulling the hair of every lady you meet, even if she is wearing gloves.’ Instead, she helpfully reminds us that ‘there are plenty of other reasons why women might wear wigs and there is certainly nothing wrong with that.’ The Centipede’s songs in <em>James and the Giant Peach </em>have gone from this: </p><blockquote><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text">Aunt Sponge was terrifically fat,
And tremendously flabby at that.
Her tummy and waist
Were as soggy as paste—
It was worse on the place where she sat!

Aunt Spiker was thin as a wire,
And dry as a bone, only drier.
She was so long and thin
If you carried her in
You could use her for poking the fire!</pre></div></blockquote><p>To, well:</p><blockquote><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text">Aunt Sponge was a nasty old brute,
And deserved to be squashed by the fruit!
We all felt a big bump
When we dropped with a thump.

Aunt Spiker was much the same
And deserves half of the blame.
Ta-ra, Aunt Spiker!
(Though we never did like her.)</pre></div></blockquote><p>Read them aloud. Just listen to it, listen to this total metrical car-crash. Who could write something so tineared and graceless? Who could bear to pick through these novels and tweezer out all the nasty bits? Only some ghastly tight-lipped puritan, some functional illiterate with a PhD, some neo-Victorian prude who wouldn’t know a creative spark if it ignited her inevitable shock of fluorescent-green hair, some entire <em>consultancy</em> of these miserable meagre creatures, a <em>hive</em> of do-gooders with their minds like leafcutter ants, nibbling away, rounding off the edges, teeming over everything, teeming over fifty centuries of written history to mulch down everything that won’t fit in our smooth plasticky present, like <em>maggots</em>, like maggots in an open wound, until at long last we’re abandoned to a future where everything is nice and gentle and dull, where there’s nothing to chew on, nothing to grapple with, nothing that might harm or horrify, just medicinal doses of kindness and empathy, universal therapy, universal wellness, showing up and being present and making space, until we’re all utterly miserable in our grey stodge of worthiness, lacking even the proper language with which to express our despair, because any appropriate speech would be too unseemly, too violent, too <em>cruel</em> for the cloying doctrines of comfort and care, too <em>cruel</em> for this parasitic fungus-network of consultancies and campaign groups sprouting its pale wet caps on the dead boughs of human culture, too <em>cruel</em> for this fainting hysterical philistine with brightly coloured hair and probably weird eyebrows too who wants to make the dog jump like a flea instead of explode. And since I’m a contrarian, this is fantastic news. I get to heroically oppose these maggoty little deeds. I can write a nice viperous denunciation against the whole thing, full of spleen and bile and exactly like the one you’ve just read: another job well done.</p><p>But because being a contrarian is the most important job in the world, it comes with <em>responsibilities</em>. Probably the best ethics of contrarianism is Nietzsche’s: ‘I attack only causes that are victorious. I attack causes only when there are no allies to be found, when I am standing alone—when I am compromising myself alone.’ Standing alone! Compromising yourself alone! Serious stuff. Sadly, very few of my fellow contrarians have lived up to this ideal. In my own grotty little country, there are large numbers of public contrarians who like to announce that they’re about to shock and disturb received opinion with their terrible insights, and then immediately start echoing the positions of the political party that’s been in government for the last decade. This is not quite the same thing. I understand that it’s difficult to come up with searing dangerous wisdom in thousand-word increments three times a week, which is why most of our print contrarians default to rote automatic wokeness or rote automatic anti-wokeness. It’s a handy shortcut. Your readers will always know exactly what they’re in for. But perhaps if you don’t have the stomach for this game, you should find another job.</p><p>Or maybe it’s become difficult to tell which causes really are victorious. A lot of brave writers like to talk about what <em>society</em> believes. <em>Society</em> believes that men’s suffering is more important than women’s, or that women’s suffering is more important than men’s. <em>Society</em> promotes harmful diet culture through images of unattainable beauty, or tries to convince us that damaged bodies are actually desirable so it can keep flogging us shitty mass-produced food. <em>Society</em> tells you that anything you do for your own enjoyment is a waste of time when you could be engaged in productive work, or it blasts you in the face with thousands of hours of worthless entertainment. In either case, our contrarians can come up with some social media posts from their enemies, vaguely standing in for the general atitudes of society at large: <em>see, I’m the only one standing up against the tyranny of these idiots</em>. The problem, I think, is that our society is broadly shaped by a complex network of relations that’s still vaguely identifiable as capitalism, and capitalism is a big heaving protean mass primarily composed of its own contradictions, and which instead of upholding one side or another of any given binary tends instead to produce the entire terrain in which the opposition itself is grounded. This is an annoying state of affairs. Maybe something ought to be done.</p><p>But every so often, all the forces really do seem to be arrayed on one side, and the Roald Dahl censorship debacle is one of them. <em>Everyone</em> hates this thing. Readers hate it. Parents hate it. The right-wing press hates it. The left-wing press hates it. Salman Rushdie hates it. The Prime Minister hates it. I hate it too. We all agree that trying to make Dahl <em>nice</em> is the most absurd project imaginable; that the nasty streak running through his work can’t be safely snipped out because it’s what holds the whole thing together. In fact, I could only find one solitary essay in which someone tried to actually <em>defend</em> this decision, which came from the <em>Guardian</em>’s Gaby Hinsliff. To loudly inveigh against the <em>Guardian</em>’s Gaby Hinsliff is not exactly sporting. So because I am a contrarian, I will do what nobody else will. I will argue that everyone who is so aghast at these changes, from the PM down, is actually wrong. Their blank consensus, their ideological insistence that a fictional dog <em>must</em> explode. This stuff should be celebrated! We’re making great, incredible strides! Do more! Bowdlerise the whole lot, every old book we can get our hands on! But <em>especially</em> Dahl—because sanitising his books isn’t any kind of betrayal. It’s perfect fidelity to the spirit of his work. </p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><div><hr></div><p>Roald Dahl first encountered the cruelty of the world in 1923, when he was eight years old. Here’s how he describes it:</p><blockquote><p>As the first stroke landed and the pistol-crack sounded, I was thrown forward so violently that if my fingers hadn’t been touching the carpet, I think I would have fallen flat on my face. As it was, I was able to catch myself on the palms of my hands and keep my balance. At first I heard only the <em>crack</em> and felt absolutely nothing at all, but a fraction of a second later the burning sting that flooded across my buttocks was so terrific that all I could do was gasp. I gave a great gushing gasp that emptied my lungs of every breath of air that was in them. </p><p>It felt, I promise you, as though someone had laid a red-hot poker against my flesh and was pressing down on it hard.</p><p>The second stroke was worse than the first and this was probably because Mr Coombes was well practiced and had a splendid aim. He was able, so it seemed, to land the second one almost exactly across the narrow line where the first one had struck. It is bad enough when the cane lands on fresh skin, but when it comes down on bruised and wounded flesh, the agony is unbelievable. </p></blockquote><p>Dahl had been sent out into an era in which adults routinely and legally practised a form of minor torture on small children. A sadism that was never entirely asexual. Make the children bend over and cause them pain. Flog their tender white buttocks. Bring messy red welts out of that fresh new skin. A child, terrified and utterly defenceless, with his fleshy parts turned towards the thundering, incomprehensible justice of the adult world.</p><p>That caning seems to have left Dahl bruised and wounded for the rest of his life. So many of his villains have this thing in common: they are adults who like to do violence to small children. Mrs Trunchbull with her medieval torture devices. The Child-Catcher he inserted into his script for <em>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</em>. The witches who will turn you into vermin, and the giants who come to gobble you up. Dahl describes the headmaster who delivered his caning as ‘a giant of a man with a face like a ham and a mass of rusty-coloured hair that sprouted in a tangle all over the top of his head.’ In fact, Mr Coombes was probably a perfectly ordinary, maybe mild, maybe quite liberal-minded man; someone who had given over his life to educating the young. But ‘all grown-ups appear as giants to small children.’ Every minor clerk in a world that physically hurts its children is already halfway a Bonecruncher or a Fleshlumpeater: where adults see a cloud of vague abstractions, Discipline and Instruction and Teaching Right From Wrong, children can only see these vast powerful figures and their ability to inflict pain. All Dahl does is crystallise this subjective impression in prose.</p><p>So maybe you could argue that it’s <em>fine</em> to get rid of all the exploding dogs, because Dahl’s work is at root a protest against cruelty, and the circle of beings we want to protect from cruelty now includes fictional dogs. But it’s not so simple, is it? Because alongside all these terrible child-torturing villains, there’s also Willy Wonka, who does the <em>exact same thing</em>: every child who goes through his gates, with one exception, ends up mangled and broken, punished for chewing too much gum or watching too much TV. It turns out that Dahl didn’t mind swishing the cane a little himself. </p><p>I was about eight years old myself when I first read Dahl describe his caning, a quarter of a century ago. That passage stuck with me too. I had never been physically hurt by a teacher, or any authority figure, but there was still something intensely <em>charismatic</em> about that situation, something irresistible about all that pain and punishment. I wanted—not corporal punishment, exactly, but <em>something</em>, more of that incredibly rich scenario on the page. Go over to the big shelf where you keep your 24-volume <em>Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud</em>, get down Book XVII, and check pages 175 to 204, <em>A Child is Being Beaten</em>. ‘Who was the child that was being beaten? The one who was himself producing the phantasy or another? Was it always the same child or as often as not a different one? Who was it that was beating the child? A grown-up person? And if so, who? Or did the child imagine that he himself was beating another one? Nothing could be ascertained that threw any light upon all these questions—only the hesitant reply: ‘I know nothing more about it: a child is being beaten.’’ In fact, Freud discovers, the beating-fantasy is something profoundly ambiguous and reversible. Sometimes you’re the child being beaten, a masochist, delighting in the punishment. Sometimes you’re looking on, a quiet sadist, delighting in stranger and more delicate ways. This is why children love books about horrible things happening to children. In a book, you’re not locked in one or another position: you get to pick.</p><p>But in fact, you don’t even need Freud to tell you all this; Dahl does it for us. Why, exactly, did the enormous Mr Coombes decide to take a rod to his flesh? He explains the backstory in some detail. We begin with the young Roald and his little Sadean friends, who spend their afternoons outside a sweet shop, staring through the windows at its delights: ‘Bull’s-eyes and Old Fashioned Humbugs and Strawberry Bonbons and Glacier Mints and Acid Drops and Pear Drops and Lemon Drops and all the rest of them.’ All the money they have ends up going on sweets. But at the same time, they’re convinced that these beautiful objects are all made from <em>dead rats</em>. This is how liquorice bootlaces are made:</p><blockquote><p>They wait until they’ve got ten thousand rats, then they dump them all in a huge shiny steel cauldron and boil them up for several hours. Two men stir the bubbling cauldron with long poles and in the end they have a thick steaming rat-stew. After that, a cruncher is lowered into the cauldron to crunch the bones, and what’s left is a pulpy substance called rat-mash. The two men who were doing the stirring with the long poles now put on their Wellington boots and climb into the cauldron and shovel the hot rat-mash out on to a concrete floor. Then they run a steamroller over it several times to flatten it out. All they have to do after that is to wait for it to cool and harden so they can cut it up into strips.</p></blockquote><p>This thing you love is also an object of horror. Not just because it’s made from rat-mash, but because the woman who owns the sweetshop is a monster herself, a ‘skinny old hag with a moustache on her upper lip and a mouth as sour as a green gooseberry’ called Mrs Pratchett. Her fingers are black with grime. Her little mind is sharp with evil. So the children decide to punish Mrs Pratchett. They find a dead mouse—an incredible, wonderful find—and then contrive to sneak it into one of her jars of sweets. To join the other vermin. To pollute their own enjoyments with the truth of what they really are. To glory in their own ugliness. And then they’re discovered, and so they must be caned. The circle is closed, with a violence that’s precisely equivalent to a dead mouse or a Strawberry Bonbon: delicious.</p><p>This is basically the schema of all of Dahl’s work: everything pleasurable is also hideous, and everything hideous is also pleasurable. I think that this kind of cycling—between sadism and masochism, horror and delight, transgression and punishment—is actually integral to what we call literature. Or, at least, to <em>good</em> literature, which is always a kind of self-conscious cruelty. I am not the first to reach this conclusion. See, for instance, Bataille: ‘The knowledge of Evil is the basis of intense communication… Literature is not innocent. It is guilty and should admit itself so.’ But really the need for nastiness should be self-evident: just look what’s left when it’s gone. When that cycling is absent, when writing refuses to properly incorporate its own evil, what you get is <em>Harry Potter</em>.</p><div><hr></div><p>So <em>now</em> you tedious fuckers have stopped liking <em>Harry Potter</em>, have you? After decades—<em>decades</em>—in which you simply would not shut up about your potions and wands, now JK Rowling has turned into She Who Must Not Be Named? She made her bed with you lot, didn’t she? After hosing down the entire planet in her milky moralistic slop, this limp wash of resentful goodness, can she really be <em>surprised</em> that this generation she made turned out to be exactly what she made them?</p><p>There’s currently a large, concerted effort underway to rehabilitate JK Rowling’s reputation: to prove that actually, she is completely innocent of being a transphobe and a bigot. Podcasts, opinion columns, interviews, the whole full-bore PR campaign. And of course, of <em>course</em> she is innocent. I don’t mean in relation to these specific charges, which I have not investigated and never will: I simply <em>do not care</em> whether JK Rowling is a transphobe, and I would suggest that if any similar statements of the type <em>person X is a thing Y</em> matter even remotely to you then your intracranial fluid is probably leaking all down your neck. I mean that JK Rowling is <em>dispositionally</em> innocent; that innocence is her entire strategy. Compare Rowling to Dahl, whose strategy was a cheerful embrace of guilt. Dahl was, by all accounts, a fairly unpleasant person: a shagger, a cad, a distant father, an unfaithful husband, the whole package. Once, he was asked how he’d like to be remembered; he replied with a line from Hillaire Belloc. ‘When I am dead, I hope it may be said: his sins were scarlet, but his books were read.’ Dahl was also, notoriously, a bigot. Everyone else keeps repeating his nice little line about the Jews, so I may as well repeat it too: ‘Even a stinker like Hitler didn’t just pick on them for no reason.’ (Worse than the content, really, is that wording. <em>A stinker like Hitler</em>. The Final Solution as an unpleasantness like Mrs Pratchett’s fingernails.) A few months before his death, he made the stakes very clear. ‘I am certainly anti-Israel, and I have become antisemitic.’ No tiptoeing around with <em>tropes</em> and <em>themes</em> here, no big-nosed goblins who happen to run the banks, or ambiguous statements about <em>women’s sex-based rights</em>: he went out of this world strapped to an enormous sign that read <em>I DON’T CARE FOR THE JEWS</em>. And yet. My Jewish primary school organised events around Roald Dahl Day every year. We all trooped into assembly dressed up as our favourite characters, like a second Purim. The teachers must have known that this man we were celebrating also hated us for something as insignificant as our race, but they didn’t care. This is healthy. It’s not a question of separating the art from the artist, or any other such warmed-over babble—there’s simply not much <em>point</em> in accusing Dahl of being a shit, because he already knew he was a shit; he announces it from every page.</p><p>But Rowling wants to be innocent.</p><p>Seven years ago, I wrote that the <em>Harry Potter</em> books were ‘never for children and always for the bored 29-year-old human resources workers they would grow into.’ I was right, of course; the germ of the whole enterprise is a tiny, glinty shard of quotidian moral cowardice. This is how the fantasy works: it allows you to imagine that you are actually incredibly <em>special</em>. Nobody else can see it, but you don’t really belong to the ordinary boring world, where you sit in some grey office with all the other muggles and send emails for a living; you are a wizard; you are <em>magic</em>. There’s an entire other realm out there, waiting to receive you. And not just that: in this other realm, it just so happens that you’re the Chosen One, the <em>most important person who ever lived</em>. Not because of any of your actual qualities, of course (because you don’t really have any): you were stamped with this special status practically from birth. The problem is that anyone who could actually believe all this would inevitably be a nasty, self-absorbed, self-important monster. So Rowling creates an entire class of demonically evil wizards who can safely contain this aspect of the fantasy. The negative features of your own narcissism assume the form of a pale, noseless villain: it has nothing to do with you; <em>your</em> hands are still clean. (You can even see this at work in the Hogwarts house system; as I wrote last time, Gryffindors are ‘fascists according to fascist ideology itself, the ideal-ego of the fascist subject: a natural elite, strong, noble, honourable,’ while Slytherins are <em>the exact same type</em> but as viewed from outside.) That’s it. That’s all there really is. The mythos, the grand moral conflict, the worldbuilding and whimsy—it’s all just the scotomisation of someone who refuses to consider that they might not only be wonderful and special and good. </p><p>Not so long ago, people who liked <em>Harry Potter</em> had a strange tic that caused them to compare absolutely everything that happened in the world to these piddling books. <em>Hillary is Hermione! Donald Trump is a Voldemort! </em>(Even Rowling herself was at it; for a while, every time she took some tedious conservative position on Palestine or Scottish independence or the Labour leadership, she felt the need to qualify that these weren’t just <em>her</em> opinions, but also the opinions of Dumbledore and all the other magical wizards who lived inside her head.) Given that these books present an atrociously crude moral universe, this is a very strange thing to do; comparing Trump to Voldemort has all the rhetorical punch of comparing him to the Big Bad Wolf. But now, these people’s refusal to read another book might start to make a little more sense. When you say that Trump is Voldemort, you’re saying that he represents all those aspects of <em>yourself</em> that you find unbearable, that you have to hide from and repress.</p><p>Times have changed. These days, the broad opinion among the exact same milieu is that JK Rowling is Hitler in a dress, and any contact with her works means giving your implicit support to death camps for sexual minorities. Do not read <em>Harry Potter</em>. Do not watch the <em>Harry Potter</em> films. Do not play the new <em>Harry Potter</em> game. Do not so much as speak Rowling’s name, unless you’re going to asterisk out some letters and prefix it with the words ‘fuck’ or ‘kill.’ There are dozens, hundreds, of first-person essays out there about how the author has chosen—with regret, with such deep sadness—to let go of this magical realm. <em>Since consuming different types of entertainment media is the only form of political action that has ever existed in human history, I’ve decided I can no longer consume these particular ones about wizards. Rowling’s malignant evil has poisoned every word on these pages. Every sentence I read would directly lead to the deaths of thousands of my trans siblings, and this is a cost I am no longer willing to bear</em>. They say they’ve finally given up on it; in fact, they’ve done nothing of the sort. The <em>Harry Potter</em> complex is still there, still has its iron grip on their entire relation to themselves and the world. Blank out every evil. Make its name unsayable. Never acknowledge your own nastiness. Never admit the secret pleasures of evil. We are the magnificent ones. We can engage in infinite, limitless cruelty—precisely because we are <em>not</em> cruel, because we are the innocent and the good. </p><div><hr></div><p>What I’m saying is that any writer who gets successful enough will, eventually, get exactly the reception they deserve. In a certain tragic, cosmic sense, Rowling <em>deserved</em> her cancellation: not because of whatever she did or didn’t say about whatever urgent social issue, but because this blanking-out of the bad was already the real content of her work. And Roald Dahl deserved his bowdlerisation too, because that is also what he had invited in.</p><p>Dahl’s books for children are essentially a delirious vision of power; their real content is the secret pleasure of filth, ugliness, and <em>punishment</em>. But power has changed. It no longer looks like a headmaster brutally whipping some miscreant boy. State schools in the UK abolished corporal punishment in 1982, when Dahl was still alive; in private schools, the practice was outlawed by the turn of the twenty-first century. Even a posh kid like me managed to miss out entirely on being subjected to the English vice. If you know your Foucault, you know how this works. Outright physical punishment, with its sinister arrays of torture implements, its whips and flogs and canes, its criminals torn apart piece by piece before a braying crowd, starts to vanish. In its place, you get something so much softer and gentler. This new thing doesn’t want to hurt you; quite the opposite. It wants you to be healthy and thriving and well. It wants to steer you imperceptibly towards what is good. It wants to banish every residue of nastiness. But it’s still exactly the same thing that it was in the days of private flogging and public executions, which is cruelty and power.</p><p>The people who hate the new, safer, kinder version of Roald Dahl are <em>also</em> in flight from the literature of cruelty. They see these new editions, with the dog that jumps like a flea instead of exploding, and they quite accurately conclude that it’s horrible. But this is <em>precisely why it’s true to the spirit of his work</em>. You want Dahl to be <em>good</em>? You want to keep all the stuff you like—the sadism, the kick in the pants, the sideways jab at bald women—and not let anything else spoil your fun? You want to fence off these books against anything that might unsettle you, anything that isn’t in line with your values? Have you <em>heard</em> yourself? It’s time to update these books, to let the text evolve in accordance with the times. No longer a monument to the cruelty of a now-distant age, but a profound expression of the smiling, sanitised, inclusive cruelty of today. </p><p>The challenge Dahl presents us with is not to <em>resist</em> the terrible and stupid exercise of power, but to find ways to <em>enjoy</em> it. Embrace the sensitivity readers, the bloodless consultancies, the illiterates with PhDs and weird eyebrows. Because their sweets are made of rat-mash. Because their discipline is arbitrary and cruel. Because they are among the monsters of our age—and you, in the most forbidden coils of yourself, are among the monsters too.</p>

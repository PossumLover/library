This was his shew-stone, a magic mirror he and his scryer used to communicate with angels. In Dee’s own account, recorded in his <em>Five Books of Mystery</em>, this object was delivered to him by the angels themselves. One of them told him that ‘one thing is yet wanting; a mete receptacle. There is yet wanting a stone. One there is, most excellent, hid in the secret of the depth. In the uttermost part of the Roman Possession… Thow shalt haue it. Thow shalt haue it. Thow shalt haue it. Dost thow see, loke and styr not from thy place.’ But Dee saw nothing. The angels directed him to a point in the corner of his room where the mirror would appear. ‘Then I saw like a shaddow on the grownd or matts hard by my bokes under the west wyndow. The shaddow was rowndysh, and less than the palm of my hand. I put my hand down uppon it, I felt a thing cold and hard: which, taking up, I perceyued to be the stone.’ A mirror made of shadows, calcified out of the ordinary shadows in an ordinary room. </p><p>But a few years ago, researchers found another origin for the shew-stone. X-ray fluorescence analysis found that the levels of manganese, rubidium, strontium, and yttrium in Dee’s mirror precisely matched those of obsidian sourced from mines near the Mexican city of Pachuca. This was once an <em>acaltezcul</em>, an Aztec divinatory mirror, and these were sacred to the god Tezcatlipoca, the Smoking Mirror. A mirror shows you exactly what’s in front of you, and Tezcatlipoca was the Lord of the Near and Nigh, an everyday god who planted the seed in every womb and ruled over all the small necessities of life—but he was also the god of jaguars, invisibility, obsidian, night, and shadows. Even among the Aztec deities, this was a particularly sinister figure, whose main function in human affairs was as a source of limitless, random malice. ‘His hand was seen most clearly when a man rich in all good fortune, with many sons, wealth and honours, was suddenly, gratuitously, brought low.’ The fickle king of a senseless cruel world. One of his names was <em>Titlacahuan</em>, He Whose Slaves We Are. Another was <em>Moquequeloa</em>, the Mocker. Or <em>Necoc Yaotl</em>, the Enemy on Both Sides. Tezcatlipoca does not transcend the ordinary world; he <em>is</em> that world, and he is your enemy. Still, it wouldn’t be quite right to think of him as something totally external, the bad thing into which we innocents have been thrown. When you look into a mirror, what’s the first thing you see?</p><p>I am aware that you did not decide to click on this essay because you wanted to hear about sixteenth-century wizards or sinister Nahuatl gods. You’re here because you are the lowest creature imaginable: the kind of grass-eating mental ungulate that actually wants to read another witless diatribe either for or against wokeness. And I will give you what you want. I will feed you hogs your swill. I will stop prevaricating with obsidian mirrors and get to the actual point. But there’s a reason I started with the mirror, and part of it is that you need to <em>look at yourself</em>. Look at what you’ve reduced yourself to. Look at the enemy to yourself that you’ve become.</p><div><hr></div><p>You might have noticed that over the last week or so, half the world’s paid and unpaid commentators have suddenly started putting out their own boutique definition of <em>wokeness</em>. Since the precise definition of wokeness is, in 2023, about as relevant as the precise borders of the Aztec Triple Alliance, this seems like a fairly dry academic exercise, but somehow the project has managed to produce a lot of excitement. As far as I can tell, we’re in this hole because some right-wing critic wrote a book decrying the evils of wokeness, and then when she was asked on TV to define what <em>woke</em> actually meant she <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/3901688-conservative-author-bethany-mandel-struggles-to-come-up-with-definition-of-woke/">couldn’t provide an answer</a>. This must have understandably led some people to conclude that <em>woke</em> doesn’t really refer to anything at all, that it’s a deliberately amorphous name for an essentially fictive enemy, to be bandied about by various oleaginously entrepreneurial conservative commentators—because now we’ve all been drafted into this game of pulling out our definitions of wokeness and comparing sizes. As it happens, I do think that wokeness is (or, frankly, <em>was</em>) a real phenomenon, and that it has a definition; I’m going to be showing you mine in just a moment. But it still strikes me as significant that while many of these definitions have been perfectly coherent and sometimes even persuasive, <em>no two of them have been entirely the same</em>. </p><p>This is, I think, because all these definitions are based on a category error. According to Freddie deBoer, wokeness is a less descriptive term for social justice politics. According to Wesley Yang, wokeness is a successor ideology to liberalism. According to John McWhorter (and many, many others), wokeness is a new kind of religion. But it’s not a politics, or an ideology, or a religion. If you’ve ever spent any time in a political movement, or a religious one—even a <em>philosophical</em> one—you’ll have noticed that these things always have <em>sects</em>. Small differences in doctrine turn into antagonistic little groups. There are dozens of denominations that all claim to be the universal catholic church. Put two Marxists in a room and you’ll get three different ideological schisms. As Richard Rorty once noted, the split between the left-Hegelians and the right-Hegelians was eventually resolved at ‘a six-month-long seminar called the Battle of Stalingrad.’ Even Scientology has them; there is an entropy that tugs at all attempts to organise the world by thought. But it’s hard to see any such thing happening in any of the movements that get described as <em>woke</em>. Black Lives Matter did not have a ‘left’ or a ‘right’ wing; the different rainbow flags did not belong to rival queer militia; the followers of Ibram X Kendi did not send their most subtle clerics to debate against the heresies of the DeAngeloites. The spaces these movements produce might be the sites of constant churning mutual animosity and backstabbing, but the faultlines are always interpersonal and never substantive. This is very, very unusual. Of course, there’s always the possibility that the woke mind virus is so perfectly bioengineered that it’s left all its victims without any capacity for dissent whatsoever, permanently trapped in a zombielike groupthink daze. This is the kind of possibility that a lot of antiwoke types like to entertain. Let me sketch out an alternative view. </p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>The one thing almost every definition of wokeness has in common is that they all approach wokeness as a set of <em>beliefs</em>. So: wokeness is the belief that modern society is structured by a series of interlinking oppressions that must be torn down to achieve justice. Wokeness is the belief that people from disadvantaged groups should be given a special epistemic or moral status. Wokeness is the belief that all social problems are, at root, problems of personal bigotry. Wokeness is the belief that human subjectivity is primarily conditioned by identity-categories, and that those identity-categories are either natural and essential and perfectly map to the deep contours of the self, <em>or</em> that they’re the product of a cruel history of social construction, <em>or</em> that they’re a question of free self-identification; take your pick. See how you’re thinking yourself in knots here. The problem is that intellectuals—myself included—are a weird, clammy, undersocialised lot, who spend a lot more time floating around in the bubbly otherworld of ideas than engaging with actual people. What happens if you ask a <em>woke</em> person what wokeness is? They’ll tell you that actually, there’s no such thing as wokeness. It’s not an ideology. It’s not a belief system. It’s just basic decency. It’s just being a <em>good person</em>.</p><p>They’re right. Wokeness is an <em>etiquette</em>. There are no sects within wokeness for the same reason that there are no sects on whether you should hold a wine glass by the bowl or by the stem. It’s not really about dogmas or beliefs, in the same way that table manners are not the <em>belief</em> that you should only hold a fork with your left hand. </p><p>Here’s a question: is <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udJJFAojBgs">Cornel West</a></em> woke? Well, he wrote the foreword to my edition of the <a href="https://thenewpress.com/books/critical-race-theory">standard academic reader</a> of texts from the canon of critical race theory, and there’s nothing to suggest that he’s changed his views since. He does, in fact, take the view that modern society is structured by a series of interlinking oppressions which must be torn down to achieve justice. But at the same time, he is obviously, <em>obviously</em> not part of this thing. Not only because you’re more likely to find him in conversation with Glenn Loury than Nikole Hannah-Jones; the man is simply not <em>polished</em> enough. He has gaps in his teeth. He dresses like an undertaker. Brother Cornel speaks an entirely different language; his intonation is all gospel and apocalypse, not therapy, not form-filling, not careful bourgeois obeisances, not telling you that you’re valid, not the needle-sharp cruelty of the <em>nice</em>. His intellectual project is fuelled by an urgent, thunderous humanism. He is not trying to be polite. You can devote your whole life to queer theory or disability activism or any other social-justice cause you like, and as long as you still have something like a soul you will never once be woke.</p><p>What makes something woke is a very simple operation: the transmutation of political demands into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1Mptgi23YE">basically arbitrary</a> standards of interpersonal conduct. The goal is never to actually overcome any existing injustices; political issues are just a way to conspicuously present yourself as the <em>right kind of person</em>. There’s no better example than the George Floyd protests three years ago. Three years ago, millions of people took to the streets in the largest mass action in American history, and what did it actually achieve? A few newspapers started capitalising the <em>B</em> in <em>Black</em>. A few gurning podcasters lost their jobs. That was about it. All the initial energy was sapped away, and after the riots we were all invited to the infinite circus of <em>being good</em>, addressing your biases and checking your microagressions and endlessly schmeckeling around with your terrible terrible privilege. Back in 2020, a few people in my vague social orbit started talking about how the <em>real work </em>of opposing racial inequality, the <em>hard</em> work, was all about confronting your own complicity. When I suggested that actually, no, the real hard work would involve some kind of massive state action to address poverty, they tended to react like I’d just shat on the dinner table. And they were right. I’d made the mistake of approaching what they were saying as a political statement, when actually they were just trying to be polite. The kind of mistake only idiots and foreigners make: it was as if they’d asked me how I was doing, and I’d actually told them. </p><p>I think a lot of things make a lot more sense when viewed in this light. The way that so much of this discourse seems to focus exclusively on the spectre of uncouth material in entertainment media. All the interminable sumptuary codes over which type of person gets to eat or wear or say which type of thing. People who say <em>unhoused</em> instead of <em>homeless</em>, as if that would somehow help. Of course getting an academic post now requires submitting a detailed statement of your social-justice bona fides. It’s not about enforcing ideological conformity; it’s just that these are jobs for good, decorous people. Once your head of department would take you out to dinner and watch what you did with your napkin. Now it’s something else. Of course people who make the mistake of trying to earnestly disagree with this stuff sometimes get hounded out of their work. It’s not the Stasi or the Red Guards, it’s just some stately dowager, fixed in sherry-dribbling horror as you fail to use the correct form of address for the nephew of a duke. And of course the language is so utterly sterile, so clinical and impersonal, allowing you to relate to other people as bundles of demographic categories and traumata and nothing else. The main function of almost any etiquette is to <em>formalise</em> social relationships, to pad out any dangerous encounter between human beings with so much ritual that there’s less chance of anyone getting hurt.</p><p>You might be less than thrilled by these developments. Maybe you’re attached to the great twentieth-century experiment in informality. Maybe you’ve noticed that every system of etiquette is a half-sneering <em>class</em> project. Maybe you’re on the left, and you object to your political principles being turned into the stage for someone else’s preening performance of virtue. Or maybe you simply find all this stuff deeply <em>annoying</em>, which it is; this suffocating atmosphere of prim priggish tight-lipped tedium. Luckily for you, individual programmes of politesse tend to be very, very fragile. If one young aristocrat goes out without his top hat, then he’s underdressed. But if two or three do it, then it’s <em>everyone else</em> who’s suddenly stuffy and behind the times. This is why I prefer to speak about wokeness in the past tense: the process is already underway.</p><p>In a few years, we might see another code take root. Maybe it’ll be the drug panic again. Maybe big companies will spend millions educating their workforces on just saying no. Maybe celebrities will be publicly cancelled for being spotted with white rings around their nostrils. Don’t you know the <em>harm</em> you’re doing to the <em>children</em>? Don’t you know that drugs <em>kill</em>? But as it happens, there’s already a rival system of manners waiting in the wings to become the next tedious and inescapable social law, and it calls itself <em>antiwokeness</em>.</p><div><hr></div><p>Lately, I’ve been watching the basically terrible Israeli TV drama <em>Fauda</em>, which is about an elite IDF unit that doesn’t hate Arabs. These are <em>mista’aravim</em>, operatives who work undercover in the occupied Palestinian Territories, dressing like Arabs, speaking like Arabs, praying in the mosques, bedding the women. Most of their parents or grandparents were born in the Arab world: they like speaking the language, rolling those lovely poetic syllables around in their mouths. So different from the blank flat Hebrew they have to speak in ordinary life. One of them lives on a ranch on the fringes of the Negev; his only real friends are the local Bedouins. They understand him; the civilians in his life do not. When he’s in despair, he simply vanishes into the West Bank to be a Palestinian for a while. And yes, every time our heroes put on their Arab costumes and go out into Jenin they do end up killing a lot of Arabs—but they still don’t hate them. There are some people in Israel who just want the Palestinians <em>gone</em>: rounded up and exiled, or executed, or whatever; it doesn’t matter much either way. But not these people. They love having the Occupied Territories on their doorstep, this primitive zone of the id where you can salve all your secular neuroses, this black Conradian playground of torture and death. Slip through the checkpoint and all the rules change. If the knitted-kippah brigade got their way, if the entire West Bank were turned into nothing but yeshivas and frozen yoghurt shops and no more Arabs, it would rip a hole through their hearts. They’d have to move to Beirut.</p><p>Something like <em>Fauda</em> is only possible because there’s a deep genocidal current running through Israeli society; you need a Smotrich to make our <em>mista’aravim</em> look like like nice culturally open liberals. Most of the time things are not so clear-cut. Adorno and Horkheimer describe the antisemites of Europe, who ‘detest the Jews and imitate them constantly. There is no antisemite who does not feel an instinctive urge to ape what he imagines to be Jewishness. The same mimetic codes are constandy used: the argumentative jerking of the hands, the singing tone of voice, which vividly animates a situation or a feeling independently of judgment, and the nose, that physiognomic <em>principium individuationis</em>, which writes the individual's peculiarity on his face.’ Eighty years down the line, it’s Jews dressing up as Arabs. This is the secret of Tezcatlipoca: the hated enemy is also a mirror. </p><p>So with that in mind—what does it mean, exactly, to be antiwoke?</p><p>Nobody really asks this question. Unlike <em>wokeness</em>, the word <em>antiwokeness</em> is still used as a self-descriptor. The antiwoke will announce themselves to you. They won’t deny that antiwokeness exists. But since there’s no fixed and generally agreed-upon account of what the object of this apophatic doctrine actually <em>is</em>, you could be forgiven for wondering whether it is, in fact, particularly real. Wokeness is not a politics. And antiwokeness is not a politics either. It’s a shew-stone. </p><p>Every day, the antiwoke are busy <em>producing</em> wokeness, catching visions of incorporeal powers, desperately willing this thing into colder and denser form. What does this look like? Hysteria over uncouth material in entertainment media. Pseudo-sociological dogshit jargon. Endless smug performances of wholesome trad virtue. To be <em>antiwoke</em> is to be just another type of person who mistakes etiquette for politics, putting all your energies into the terrain of gesture and appearance, obsessed with images, frothing at every new indecency, horrified, appalled. We must protect the children from harm! I’m sure that some day very soon, the antiwoke will have their own miserable cultural hegemony. Big companies organising compulsory free-speech training for their workers. An informal network of censors scrubbing the mass media of anything that smacks too much of progressive tyranny. Boring people have always wanted to do this sort of thing, and the ideological window-dressing has never been all that important. But when it does happen, the best way to fight it will still be the same. Stop staring at yourself in the mirror, and go and do something else. </p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Zan ye chocaya amaxtecatl aya caye chocaya tequantepehua</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>

Many of these were even successful. But while China could be egalitarian—anyone could take the imperial exams, and the Mandate of Heaven might fall on an ordinary peasant—Chinese history is also marked by a near-total absence of any democratic institutions, citizens’ councils or noble parliaments. Until the nineteenth century, revolt was always political in its character rather than social: the victorious peasants would, like the successful invaders, simply found a new dynasty. Why does the history of China keep to such a tight rhyme scheme? What were the seductions of its autocratic rule? Is there any hope for democracy in the lands once held by the Great Qing?</em></p><p><em>From now until September, Numb at the Lodge will be in China, investigating these questions and more.

Streets are thronged, people ride motorbikes on the pavement, the food is so good I keep spontaneously grinning for hours afterwards, and while the big apartment and office buildings are individually quite ugly they all come together to form a city that’s undeniably beautiful in its sheer unabashed mirrored-and-colonnaded y2k tackiness. There's a local Orangina-style soft drink called Peak Ice and it’s pretty good. At night, wannabe wanghongs pose in hanfu before the Bell Tower while their boyfriends take photos. I love it all. </p><p>Unfortunately, I am also sick as a dog. Every time I try to breathe in through my nose it produces a pathetic little sandpapery snuffle, and every time I exhale two great pendulous columns of yellow snot dangle alarmingly from my nostrils. So I’m holed up in my wondefully grotty hotel room (in a hotel where all the room numbers start with an 8, entirely irrespective of the floor they’re actually on), while my girlfriend swans around at the spa and this gorgeous city buzzes outside my window, with nothing to do except read. I have been reading about emperors. </p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>It’s hard to say exactly how many dynasties have ruled China. The first, the Xia, is shrouded in prehistory and may have never existed; others are either true dynasties or only pretender kingdoms, depending on which side you take in the squabbles of the tenth century. But of those, no less than thirteen have had their capital in Xi’an: the Western Zhou, the Qin, the Western Han, the Xin, the Han, the Western Jin, the Former Zhao, the Former Qin, the Later Qin, the Western Wei, the Northern Zhou, the Sui, and the Tang. Which is strange, given that Xi’an and the region that’s now Shaanxi were once a total backwater, on Tianxia’s furthest half-civilised fringe. </p><p>Once, this was the State of Qin, whose soldiers borrowed cavalry tactics from the desert nomads and whose princesses married their hairy stinking kings. But Qin was also the state that conquered all the other warring kingdoms of China. (This is always how it works. The bickering city-states of Greece were subdued by Philip of Macedon, who ruled a frontier kingdom on the edge of the forests where naked men roamed; Demosthenes called him a barbarian. The endless wars of Western Europe were only quelled when the whole continent was occupied by the United States, an iliterate empire off the western edge of the world.) The man who achieved this was called Zheng, King of Qin, but in 221 BC he came up with a new title for himself, <em>huangdi</em>. This is normally translated as <em>emperor</em>, but it is not the same thing. An emperor is an <em>imperator</em>: a commander, a civil official who gives orders. But the <em>huang</em> and the <em>di</em> were spirits from China’s deepest shamanic past, with names like Flint-Man and Nest-Builder, who created the world and still moved through it, invisible. Today, the <em>huang</em> and the <em>di</em> are called ‘mythical emperors,’ but before Zheng the concept of a nonmythical emperor did not exist. Zheng, or Qin Shi Huang, had declared himself a god.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb86e1375-b1bf-4e9c-8adc-7b3b6ec01035_1440x1080.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb86e1375-b1bf-4e9c-8adc-7b3b6ec01035_1440x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb86e1375-b1bf-4e9c-8adc-7b3b6ec01035_1440x1080.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb86e1375-b1bf-4e9c-8adc-7b3b6ec01035_1440x1080.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb86e1375-b1bf-4e9c-8adc-7b3b6ec01035_1440x1080.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb86e1375-b1bf-4e9c-8adc-7b3b6ec01035_1440x1080.jpeg" width="1440" height="1080" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b86e1375-b1bf-4e9c-8adc-7b3b6ec01035_1440x1080.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1080,&quot;width&quot;:1440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:277786,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb86e1375-b1bf-4e9c-8adc-7b3b6ec01035_1440x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb86e1375-b1bf-4e9c-8adc-7b3b6ec01035_1440x1080.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb86e1375-b1bf-4e9c-8adc-7b3b6ec01035_1440x1080.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb86e1375-b1bf-4e9c-8adc-7b3b6ec01035_1440x1080.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>There’s a story about Zheng from his campaigns. By 227 BC, the young Zheng had already imprisoned his mother, killed his half-brothers, crushed rebellions, and conquered the states of Han and Zhou. Now he was turning his armies against the northern kingdom of Yan. One day, a rider appeared at Zheng’s camp bearing a scroll and a severed head. The head belonged to Fan Yuqi, a general who had betrayed the state of Qin to fight for its enemies. The rider threw both at Zheng’s feet and said: ‘Son of Heaven, I present you with these two treasures as a gift. This head is the lesser treasure; I have brought it so you will know I am your friend. The greater treasure is this scroll, which is a map of the state of Yan which you wish to conquer, the most accurate map ever made.’ Slowly, the rider unrolled the map from west to east, pointing out all the features of Yan. Soon Zheng saw that this map really was the most accurate ever made. He examined a minor river, and saw clumps of ice floating in the rapids and fields glittering with springtime frost; he heard the lively chatter of the peasant-women as they took their clothes to be washed, and smelled the good sharp smell of logs burning in a stove. When he peered closer he could even see, between the brushstrokes, the footprints of those women, stamped deep in the half-frozen mud. For an instant, Zheng felt that he was very small, and the map on his table was larger than the room, larger than his tent or the camp that contained it, until it sprawled as vast as the kingdom of Yan itself.</p><p>What Zheng did not know was that this rider was not his friend, but an assassin named Jing Ke sent by the kingdom of Yan, and that Fan Yuqi had willingly sacrificed his life so the assassin would be able to approach his enemy. Jing Ke had hidden a slender dagger inside the map, and when the entire kingdom was unrolled, he would seize the dagger and thrust it into Zheng’s heart. But once the map lay flat on the table, there was no dagger to be seen. Instead, the map showed a large island in the Bohai Sea formed in the shape of a dagger: an island that had never been known of before, with cliffs where the blade had been sharpened, and forests along the line of its grooves, and mountains where precious stones had been inlaid in the dagger’s hilt.</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5c5fe05-0609-4ed9-8fd1-310a6a105a70_1440x1080.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5c5fe05-0609-4ed9-8fd1-310a6a105a70_1440x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5c5fe05-0609-4ed9-8fd1-310a6a105a70_1440x1080.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5c5fe05-0609-4ed9-8fd1-310a6a105a70_1440x1080.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5c5fe05-0609-4ed9-8fd1-310a6a105a70_1440x1080.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5c5fe05-0609-4ed9-8fd1-310a6a105a70_1440x1080.jpeg" width="1440" height="1080" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b5c5fe05-0609-4ed9-8fd1-310a6a105a70_1440x1080.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1080,&quot;width&quot;:1440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:258918,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5c5fe05-0609-4ed9-8fd1-310a6a105a70_1440x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5c5fe05-0609-4ed9-8fd1-310a6a105a70_1440x1080.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5c5fe05-0609-4ed9-8fd1-310a6a105a70_1440x1080.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5c5fe05-0609-4ed9-8fd1-310a6a105a70_1440x1080.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>When Zheng declared himself Huangdi, he committed himself to maintaining peace and good order and the tranquility of the state. So first he abolished the past. The <em>Classic of Poetry</em> and the <em>Classic of History</em> were proscribed and all copies burned. The histories of all states other than Qin were forbidden. The only books permitted were those on agriculture, medicine, augury, and the other useful sciences. His laws stated that ‘anyone who uses history to criticise the present shall have his family killed.’ He proclaimed that it was forbidden for any scholar to base any moral judgements on the ways or deeds of the time before he was enthroned, and that all philosophy should begin from the first principle that divine Huangdi must be supreme. Then he told the scholars to inform the state if any of their colleagues was thinking the wrong kind of thought. Instantly all the scholars accused all of the others, so Huangdi had them brought together to his capital at Xianyang. ‘Squabblers, women, eunuchs,’ he said, ‘if you had been of one mind you might have prevailed against me, but instead you are discordant and unharmonious, you turn against each other, you are like the chaos of the past that I have ended. There is no past for the crane whose wingtips beat against ten thousand years, neither is there any past for the people of my empire. But since you will not fly, you must dwell in the ground. And since you would prolong the dawn indefinitely, how could you witness the day?’ And with that, he had a thousand of the wisest scholars of all the Hundred Schools of Thought buried alive. Today their bones lie under the runway of Xi’an Xianyang International Airport. </p><p>Huangdi built his Great Wall. From every corner under heaven, men and women came to the northen frontier. They pushed wheelbarrows or carried everything they owned on their backs; their great migrations tore up the fields and carved new valleys into which muddy rivers flowed. Huangdi had decreed a tax: of all the matter on the earth, each of his subjects had to bring six <em>dou</em> with which to build his vision. So houses were broken apart, and the graves of ancestors were uprooted from the earth. They came with cooking utensils. They came with sacks of rice and pails of soil from their farms, or hundreds of books in delicate scrolls, or jade and cinnabar, or some well-fattened pigs, and added them to the wall. Those without possessions were not exempt from the tax. A human body has a volume equivalent to six <em>dou</em>; the ones who came to the wall with nothing to contribute were killed on the spot and their corpses added to the heap. Soon the great wall stretched from Liaodong in the east to Lintao in the west: a huge hideous mound of rotting wood and rotting bodies, plastered together with mud and shit, and swarming with flies. The wall climbed over the mountains and stretched across the desert places. It contained ten thousand temples, broken up in the rubble. Entire cities had been torn down and added to the pile. Huangdi began to dream of a wall one <em>li</em> high, the whole of China rearranged as a single line: the perfect kingdom, harmonious, with no distinction between high and low, no regions or factions, all homogenised into a single fortification, defending nothing. </p><p>All of Huangdi’s edicts began with the words ‘The World is Based on Agriculture and Mulberries.’ He knew that his wealth came from the land—but every year, so much of his millet was stolen by sparrows, and the sparrows fly in the air and even Huangdi cannot make them pay tax. So he told his people to exterminate the sparrows. They spread out across the country to find sparrow nests and smash their eggs. They waved brightly coloured flags and cried the joyful cries of war as they hunted down the tiny chittering birds. Children were formed into rampaging armies, four to each gun. When they managed to hit one they were taught to stamp on a sparrow’s fragile form until the hollow bones cracked and it was dead. Then Huangdi announced that the sparrows had been wiped out and the war had been won. No warblings plagued the streets of the cities or broke the silence of the fields. Soon there would be enough food for everyone. But without the sparrows, locusts began to multiply, and soon there were swarms of insects that blackened every corner of the sky. Entire provinces where the locusts consumed every last grain, and the people starved to death in their millions. Later, Huangdi said that there were three pests that ate millet, sparrows, locusts, and peasants, and of the three the peasants were the most dangerous. </p><p>Huangdi’s realm continued to grow. There came a day when the Central State governed eighty thousand worlds across three galaxies, all administered from his complex of painted halls at Epang. (On the site of that complex—which has long been swallowed up by Xi’an’s suburbs—there’s now a giant themed mall called Imperial Paradise.) Huangdi’s ministers told him that a rebellion had broken out on a planet called Da Zhao. Its sun, which was called Xiao Lu Zi, had sent out terrible flares, and everyone on the daylight side of the planet had been boiled alive in their skins. Some among the survivors, the ye ren, nightpeople, declared that this was a sign, that Huangdi had lost the Mandate of Heaven, and they formed armies against him, armed with spears made from sharpened reeds and poles of bamboo. Huangdi’s ministers said that the ye ren had no vessels to spread the rebellion to any other planets, but the Son of Heaven said that there was nothing more deadly than to let wrong ideas be spoken unchecked. So his vessels came to Xiao Lu Zi, and tore apart every planet in the surrounding nine systems into clouds of iron and dust, all except Da Zhao. Then they poured that iron and dust into the heart of the star until it collapsed, and the ye ren of Da Zhou found themselves orbiting a dark sca, cold and lightless and unkind. So their crops withered and the fruit shrivelled on the trees, and the ye ren groped blindly in the starry darkness, dying slowly, taunted in their endless night by the atrocity Huangdi had carved in the sky. Only afterwards did he have Da Zhou incinerated. A fragment of the planet’s core was brought back to Xianyang and erected in a courtyard as a <em>gongshi</em>, which he often looked upon, contemplating the impermanence of planets and stars. It still stands there today, outside a branch of Zara.</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd37e1220-360c-4fae-9638-d7ead14174f9_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd37e1220-360c-4fae-9638-d7ead14174f9_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd37e1220-360c-4fae-9638-d7ead14174f9_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd37e1220-360c-4fae-9638-d7ead14174f9_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd37e1220-360c-4fae-9638-d7ead14174f9_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd37e1220-360c-4fae-9638-d7ead14174f9_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d37e1220-360c-4fae-9638-d7ead14174f9_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:625991,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd37e1220-360c-4fae-9638-d7ead14174f9_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd37e1220-360c-4fae-9638-d7ead14174f9_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd37e1220-360c-4fae-9638-d7ead14174f9_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd37e1220-360c-4fae-9638-d7ead14174f9_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Huangdi began to worry that he too might die. </p><p>In 211 BC there was a miracle and an omen: a stone from Heaven landed in a village near Puyang, inscribed with the words <em>Huangdi will die</em>. Huangdi had all the inhabitants of the village killed. That same year, a mountain god appeared to a court official on the slopes of Mount Hua, presented him with a jade <em>bi</em>, and whispered that the zhulong would fall to earth. A zhulong is a dragon with a human face; Huangdi knew that the god was talking about him. He handed over the <em>bi</em> to his astrologers, who confirmed that it was one of the discs sunk into the earth by the Yellow Deity in the first days of the world. Huangdi had the <em>bi</em> smashed and the astrologers strangled to death. The courtier who had seen the mountain god was flung from a high cliff. Then, inside the walls of his palace at Epang, there was a monstrous birth: a cat produced a litter of three kittens and one lamb, which bleated the syllable <em>si</em>, meaning death. Huangdi had the lamb drowned in the river, and then burned, and then the ashes sealed in a clay pot and sunk deep into the sea. </p><p>Huangdi forbade anyone to speak the word <em>death</em> in his presence. He was an immortal. Dynasties would rise and fall, chariots would be replaced by tanks, but as long as there was a Central State, Huangdi would live. Secretly, he began consulting achemists and mystics.</p><p>One Daoist monk promised Huangdi an elixir that would give him eternal life, made from powdered jade mixed with rice. Jade, the monk explained, is the essence of the male principle, while water is the essence of the female principle, which is death; men only die because they must drink water. Huangdi gave the elixir to his son Jianglu, then took a sword and struck off Jianglu’s head. When the boy failed to come back to life, Huangdi ordered that every Daoist monk in the city should have water poured down his throat until he was dead.</p><p>The rumour went about that there was an island of immortality, somewhere in the eastern sea. A herb grew on that island that could revive the dead; birds had flown from the island with the herb in their beaks, and when they landed near the corpses that were strewn everywhere in the streets of Huangdi’s China, the men sat up and returned to work. It was also said that the mystic scholar Bai Huang knew where that island lay. Huangdi brought Bai Huang to his court and ordered him to give the island’s location on pain of the nine familial exterminations: if he refused, Bai Huang would be executed, along with his parents, his grandparents, his children, his grandchildren, his uncles and aunts, his cousins, his wife, and his wife’s parents. ‘Nine exterminations will not make me tell you what I know,’ said Bai Huang. ‘You may as well add a tenth.’ Huangdi agreed. In addition to Bai Huang’s entire family, all his students and disciples were executed. Bai Huang was made to watch as each was severed at the waist, cursing the master for his arrogant remark. Then Bai Huang was decapitated. It is said that when his head rolled onto the ground, he stuck out his tongue and traced the characters <em>Huangdi will die </em>in the dust. </p><p>But Huangdi, who could be subtle, left just one of Bai Huang’s students alive. He showed the student the pile of nine hundred corpses that had been the scholar’s family and friends, and pressed him again to reveal the whereabouts of the island of immortality. The student replied that he only knew it was in the Bohai Sea, that it was in the shape of a dagger, and that it had been formed by magic out of the absence of Huangdi’s death. But, he added, no man could ever come ashore. And Huangdi understood that he knew where the island could be found; he even had a map.</p><p>The alchemist Xu Fu offered to lead an expedition to the island of immortality. He set off with a fleet of golden ships, and returned two months later clinging to a plank. Xu Fu reported that he had seen the island, but when he drew close the mountains and the forests seemed to shimmer, until he realised that he was not looking at the island itself, but its reflection upside down in the sea, and already the ships had been wrecked. This island was made of image and imitation. But Xu Fu offered to go a second time. This time, he proposed to sail on a giant raft, with one hundred virgin boys and girls strapped to the deck. These he would sacrifice on the peak of the island’s highest mountain; their deaths would bring eternal life. Huangdi had the children kidnapped from villages across the breadth of China. He stood on the shore where the hot winds blew and watched Xu Fu’s raft depart: watched as it sped bravely across the wide glittering sea and then sank without even a ripple.</p><p>Huangdi determined to visit the island himself. He rowed on a one-man boat, which did not sink, and landed on its coast, which did not shimmer. It was silent. He noticed the abundance of every growing thing. Mosses carpeted the forest floor, even in its darkest reaches: this was an island where things did not die. Small bejewelled birds fluttered around him, or perched for a moment on Huangdi’s shoulder: they did not fear he who had extinguished stars. He began to climb, and on the summit of the mountain he found a rock carved with an inscription, which read:</p><p><em>Any man who reaches this island may become a xian </em>[immortal]<em> if in all his life he has kept to the fivefold way: first, to deal justly and wisely with others, second, to honour his parents, third, to make sacrifices at the appointed times, fourth, to obey all the commands of his sovereign, and fifth, to never shed human blood, because death is the annihilation of life: he who would live must not partake in death.</em></p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa06331b9-9af3-49a1-8bca-9fb8cfe8dac3_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa06331b9-9af3-49a1-8bca-9fb8cfe8dac3_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa06331b9-9af3-49a1-8bca-9fb8cfe8dac3_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa06331b9-9af3-49a1-8bca-9fb8cfe8dac3_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa06331b9-9af3-49a1-8bca-9fb8cfe8dac3_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa06331b9-9af3-49a1-8bca-9fb8cfe8dac3_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a06331b9-9af3-49a1-8bca-9fb8cfe8dac3_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:439236,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa06331b9-9af3-49a1-8bca-9fb8cfe8dac3_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa06331b9-9af3-49a1-8bca-9fb8cfe8dac3_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa06331b9-9af3-49a1-8bca-9fb8cfe8dac3_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa06331b9-9af3-49a1-8bca-9fb8cfe8dac3_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The theory of hydraulic despotism is usually identified with the German-American historian and anticommunist Karl Wittfogel; in fact, the first version of the idea appears in Montesquieu’s 1750 <em>Spirit of Laws</em>. ‘Asia,’ he wrote, ‘has always been the home of great empires; they have never subsisted in Europe. For the Asia of which we know has vaster plains than Europe; its springs run more easily dry, its mountains are not so covered with snow, and its rivers are lower and form lesser barriers. Power therefore must always be despotic in Asia, for if servitude were not extreme, the continent would suffer a division which the geography of the region forbids.’ Later, Adam Smith and others refined the theory.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> In Europe, the land is already fertile; a small landowner can fence off his portion and farm it by himself. But China—like Pharaonic Egypt or Gilgamesh’s Mesopotamia—is a riverine civilisation, born on the Yellow River. Before it can be fully productive, the land needs a huge system of improvements: ditches for irrigation, canals to bring the grain to market. China had a very complex series of waterworks, vaster than anything in the Mediterranean world. And to coordinate those improvements, you need a central authority, one capable of marshalling thousands of potentially unwilling peasants to dig ditches in the heat. So instead of private property in land, you get a state monopoly; instead of aristocrats, bureaucrats; instead of the movement towards capitalism, a cycle of rising and degenerating dynasties. Huangdi, Son of Heaven, who abolished the past, who snuffed out worlds and lives at will, the celestial king who could live forever—he was, in the end, only a complex piece of plumbing.</p><p>The man who had been Zheng died in 210 BC, one year after the prophetic meteor landed in Puyang. He was forty-nine years old. According to popular tradition, he died from mercury poisoning. Mercury is a toxic metal, so toxic that mercury-poisoned corpses often show no signs of physical decay. He might have drunk the poison as part of an elixir of immortality.</p><p>Like every tourist in Xi’an, I went to see the Terracotta Warriors. The usual explanation is that this army was buried near Qin Shi Huang’s grave to serve him in the afterlife. But sculpting them would have been an enormous task, and it’s not mentioned anywhere in the historical record. Nobody knew about the warriors until they were dug up in 1974. And besides, it would have been strange for Huangdi, who was so determined to never die, to make such elaborate plans for his own tomb. Maybe the army was assembled later, in secret. Maybe they were not servants, but jailers: there to make sure Qin Shi Huang, who had touched the island of immortality, remained in the ground. </p><p>Maybe it’s not so good that we’ve removed these soldiers from their posts.</p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>A version of this theory was also endorsed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who folded it into their notion of an ‘Asiatic’ mode of production. Perry Anderson critiques the concept in an appendix to <em>Lineages of the Absolutist State</em>, which I’ve cribbed from extensively. (He argues persuasively that the concept is overbroad and incoherent, but I think fails to account for why democratic notions could emerge in postfeudal Europe while China had to import them from elsewhere.) For a defence of the Asiatic mode, see Umberto Melotti’s <em>Marx and the Third World</em>. </p></div></div>

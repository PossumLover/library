It’s not a pleasant answer, and it’s also very long. But this is that answer.</em></p><div><hr></div><p>Today I’m writing from the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. For the first time since I arrived in this country, I’m outside the intense China enclosed by the Great Wall, and in the lands of the Man and Yi, the northern barbarians who wear their hair loose and button their clothes to the left, like animals. Today, these places form a thick ring of autonomous regions around China’s more fertile provinces. Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet. I’m here to see the steppe, or what’s left of it.</p><p>The steppe, it turns out, is a strangely mild place. There are no high mountains or craggy canyons here, nothing particularly majestic or sublime. Just mile after mile of green, gentle fields where nice sheep nibble at the abundant grass. The womb of the Mongol Empire looks a lot like that hill from the Windows XP background, or Teletubby-land. I thought that just walking around in this place would stir something in me: some deep buried urge, latent in the Y-DNA, to conquer the world, put cities to the sword, build pyramids of skulls. But it didn’t come. All I got was a vague sense of guilty affection for the nice sheep, and then the slight nausea when I remembered just how far this gentle countryside sprawls, just how far inland I had come, and what a lonely ocean of earth separated me from everyone I’ve ever known and loved. Inner Mongolia. What a place to end up. The problem was, of course, that I was <em>walking</em>. Walking is for city people, Europeans. Nobody walks on the steppe; you’d die before anything appeared on the horizon. This landscape has to be crossed on <em>horseback</em>, preferably at speed, and as soon as I tried that—folding my weird beansprout-body over one of those stocky, stoic Mongolian ponies that once carried death to every corner of the world—it all made sense. Underneath a galloping horse, this landscape is something very different. Not flat, not gentle, but pure <em>movement</em>, sheer animal speed. There’s nowhere to go, because everywhere’s the same; you move for the sake of moving. The endlessness of the grasslands is no longer nauseating. It <em>should</em> go on forever, this totally open world. It should unroll in every direction, it should obliterate every fixed point. There <em>should</em> be a nuclear war! Flatten the cities, flatten the mountains, boil away the sea, and I will sing to my pony as we ride over the gentle and infinite plain that used to be the world. I can live off blood and yoghurt. I can sleep in the saddle. I will ride alone.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>It’s a fantasy, of course. The world can never be only steppe; pastoral societies have always depended on trade with settled peoples. You can’t smelt iron in a yurt. And nomadic socities have always moved within clearly defined territories, except during periods of conquest and upheaval. But sometimes there are periods of conquest and upheaval. That fantasy very nearly came true in the thirteenth century, when the Mongols came pouring out of these grasslands to smooth over the world. The story goes that after conquering China, Genghis Khan decided to turn the whole country into pasture. Burn the fields of rice and millet, tear down the walls separating one plot from another, and let grass grow there instead. Feed horses and sheep, let little lambs frolic on the plain. This would have meant the biggest famine in human history, and the total extermination of the entire Chinese people. But a crafty eunuch managed to whisper in the great Khan’s ear: consider, lord, that if you were to spare the people and simply <em>tax</em> them as our emperors do, then you would be rich, you would have finery beyond anything you could imagine… So three thousand years of Chinese history did not come to an abrupt end. Only <em>half</em> the population of China was wiped out, sixty million people extinguished in the chaos and famine that followed Temujin everywhere he went. On a humanitarian level, it is a very, very good thing that he did not go ahead with his plans. But with that decision, he sealed his people’s fate. Steppe people need farmers; farmers do not need the steppe. If you let the farmers live, if you let them keep ploughing the land, then one day those poor defenceless peasants will plough your lands too. One day, the Chinese will build their polytunnels over the holy wilderness, to grow genetically modified strawberries. They will come with ploughs and tractors and PVC pipes. They will come with cameras. Eventually, the steppe will sprout holiday resorts with hundreds of fake concrete yurts, and your descendants will sing and dance for Chinese tourists, wearing a polyester mockery of your robes.</p><p>Obviously, I stayed in one of those resorts. Before dinner, the guests changed into brocaded deels and toortsogs. We sat in a big circle around a central stage, Chinese families on their weekend breaks and Chinese office workers on their teambuilding trips and me, all dressed up like Mongols. Onstage, some actual Mongols emerged to lipsync treacly songs in Chinese, while we ate the absolute worst meal I’ve ever had in this country. Smooth, synthetic meat dumplings, joyless beyond belief; a noodle souplike product; some cabbage boiled into mush. The final course was the traditional Mongolian barbecued lamb. They wheeled out three dead sheep onto the central stage and encouraged the Chinese tourists to come and dance around them with the Mongolian performers. One family took them up on the offer. The dad did a kind of dutiful half-jig as he orbited the corpses, but his wife was really getting into it, shaking her ribbons vigorously to the music with a big cheerful oh-isn’t-this-<em>fun</em> grin on her face. Meanwhile their teenage son plodded blankly behind them, obviously wishing he was looking at a screen instead. Canned throat-singing played through the speakers. I could have been at Butlin’s. Eventually the sheep were removed and we were each served a few shreds of tasteless, leathery, bone-cold meat. I’d spent the whole meal swatting away flies, but as soon as the meat was plonked down hundreds of insects started buzzing around the tables with some very intense enthusiasm. After a few attempts to shoo them away I gave in and let them have it.</p><p>After sunset came the bonfire party. The bonfire itself was mostly ignored; Chinese tourists wore glowing LED mouse ears—I’m not sure why—and danced to aggressive electro music on a concrete stage. I tried to wander away from the campsite and stare out into the darkness of the steppe, but at night the grasslands were full of bright puddles: more resorts, full of more concrete yurts, where they were also having bonfire parties. Across the vast ancient plain, beams of light spun into the sky. I could still hear a voice ringing over the wilderness. It chanted in English, over a screaming electronic beat. ‘Sex on the beach! Sex on the beach! Sex on the beach! Yeah yeah yeah!’</p><p>I met Batu outside the resort. Batu is a professional Mongol and my friend. He trains horses and wrestlers; he showed me photos from an international Mongolian wrestling competition in Japan. During the tourist season, he does odd jobs around the resort. He’s maybe forty; part of the last generation that learned to fire a bow from horseback in early childhood. The first resorts started appearing in his grasslands when he was ten. Batu doesn’t mind them. The Mongols used to be poor: if they kept the old ways, they were forced onto smaller and smaller scraps of pasture, and if the rains came late half their herds would die. Or they could move to the cities, get jobs in factories, and forget the hugeness of the sky. But now, Mongols can make good money just by riding horses and singing songs. It was Batu who took me out horseriding, galloping at a slightly scary speed over the plains. He also drove like a maniac, holding the steering wheel with one hand from the bottom, like he was holding the reins of a horse. He took me to a tiny hole in the wall restaurant in the nearest town, where the Mongols ate dumplings and guriltai shul. He didn’t seem to understand why I preferred to hang out with him in these poky places, when so many wonderful shows had been devised just for tourists like me, but he was glad. In the evening five other Mongols arrived and we all got drunk off baiju. They spoke to each other in Mongolian, Batu translated into Chinese, and my phone translated into English. I taught him to say ‘cheers.’ He taught me some Mongolian I can’t remember. Later, he showed me his small brick house and introduced me to his wife. He demonstrated some wrestling moves. He squatted outside his front door and ate an entire watermelon at astonishing speed. I asked if there was anywhere deeper in the steppe, anywhere without so many lights and people. It’s all like this, he said. </p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;7774a99c-64d2-4a29-b7ad-45f8da3920b5&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p>When Baudrillard went to America, he went looking for the <em>astral America</em>: ‘Not social and cultural America, but the America of the empty, absolute freedom of the freeways, not the deep America of mores and mentalities, but the America of desert speed, of motels and mineral surfaces.’ He knew that everything in America is really an extension of the desert. American cities are deserts, pristine zones of speed. American culture is a desert, vast and open and beautifully banal. The American economy and the American way of life and even the American body, obese or anorexic—all are born out of the prismic silicon openness of the desert. ‘I get to know more about the concrete, social life of America from the desert than I ever would from official or intellectual gatherings. American culture is heir to the deserts, but the deserts here are not part of a Nature defined by contrast with the town. Rather they denote the emptiness, the radical nudity that is the background to every human institution.’ America is another mongol empire, a steppe horde, where everything is always on the move. </p><p>What about China? Is there a cosmic China? Stupid question: of course there is. One of China’s names for itself is <em>tianchao</em>, literally <em>heavenly dynasty</em>, but most memorably translated as <em>celestial empire</em>. Everything in China is celestial, oriented to the stars; this country is one vast mirror of the sky. (In fact, the state was so strongly identified with the sky that every law code from the Tang in the seventh century to the Qing in the twentieth made all private astronomy illegal, along with ‘all instruments representing the celestial bodies.’) And like America, there are deserts here. There are wide mountains, there are stark and starry plateaus. Even if the steppe has been furrowed, this country does not lack wilderness. But it would be very difficult to argue that China <em>is</em> its wilderness.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> You’ll find cosmic China somewhere else: it’s in the canals and irrigation works, the dikes and walls, the endless striations, the perfect north-south meridian that runs through the Forbidden City and aligns the world. China’s other name for itself is <em>zhongguo</em>, or <em>central state</em>. The Son of Heaven is at the centre of the world, surrounded by lush fields and civilised men; the barbarians and deserts are at the furthest edge. It’s sometimes necessary for the Central State to extend its reach <em>into</em> that desert, which is why China’s borders contain so much of it. But in every era, China has had a particular horror of smooth, open, deterritorialised, barbarian space.</p><p>I’ve seen it myself: it’s impossible to travel through China without noticing just how <em>dense</em> everything is. The Chinese countryside is a mesh of tiny farms: each lopsided rectangle of rice or vegetables comes with its own cement house, and all these little pieces are crammed together in an endless jigsaw that covers the entire country. Tiny farms tight in the mountain valleys. Tiny farms terracing the hillsides. They jostle together in the plains, they crowd in the shadow of the cities. This is the biggest country I’ve ever visited, but everything <em>feels</em> very small, and the numbers bear me out here. In America, the average farm is 445 acres. In the UK, it’s 175; in France it’s 170. The average farm in China is <em>one acre large</em>. Smaller than a football pitch. But <em>old</em>: the lines between these little plots can outlast dynasties. All of Chinese history is one long tussle over the cup of rice or the handful of beans that can be wrung out of each of these hundred million tight-packed fields. How many ancient resentments, struggles, hatreds, are packed into every square foot of this land? How many bones buried under every farm? During the Land Reform Movement, the Communists would sometimes come to a village without any big landlords, so they’d just find the peasant with the biggest field and have the other peasants torture him to death. You can understand why. When land is so tight, human life becomes cheap. The intensity of agriculture made Chinese peasants deeply vulnerable to famine whenever the rains failed or the rivers burst their banks; disasters that would have killed thousands of Europeans kill millions of Chinese. This country is <em>suffocating</em>. That tightness is everywhere, even in the language. The classical Chinese words for <em>space</em> and <em>time</em> are 宇<em>, </em> and 宙, both of which contain 宀, the <em>house</em> radical. Once, 宇 referred to the eaves of a building, and 宙 to its roof-beams. In China, abstract space isn’t open or infinite; it’s the enclosed, the dark and domestic, with mud floors and rain hammering down on your corrugated-iron roof. Put the two characters together, 宇宙, and you get the Chinese word for <em>universe</em>. One big hovel. One cosmic slum.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e915ae0-f3e6-4a53-a8a5-99ad61f28198_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e915ae0-f3e6-4a53-a8a5-99ad61f28198_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e915ae0-f3e6-4a53-a8a5-99ad61f28198_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e915ae0-f3e6-4a53-a8a5-99ad61f28198_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e915ae0-f3e6-4a53-a8a5-99ad61f28198_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e915ae0-f3e6-4a53-a8a5-99ad61f28198_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2e915ae0-f3e6-4a53-a8a5-99ad61f28198_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:339992,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e915ae0-f3e6-4a53-a8a5-99ad61f28198_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e915ae0-f3e6-4a53-a8a5-99ad61f28198_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e915ae0-f3e6-4a53-a8a5-99ad61f28198_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e915ae0-f3e6-4a53-a8a5-99ad61f28198_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>China is crowded in space. But it’s so much <em>more</em> crowded in time.</p><p>I discovered this a few weeks ago, after my visit to the Maoist village of Nanjie in Henan province. Because Nanjie is a tiny, weird village, it doesn’t have its own high-speed rail station; for that, I had to get a cab to the city of Xuchang, half an hour up the road. I’d never heard of the place. I arrived at Xuchang East Railway Station on the very edge of the city, with three hours to kill before my train. Since there didn’t seem to be anything better to do, I decided to walk all the way to the centre; if I timed it right, I reasoned, I could grab some lunch, jump in a taxi back to the station, and still have twenty minutes spare before they started herding people onto the platform. So I set off. I walked along a monstrously wide and weirdly empty avenue, past high-rise block after identical high-rise block. The whole city seemed geometrically sterile. Even small cities in China have this monumental Manhattan-like regularity, and Xuchang is a small city. Somewhere between four and five million people: piddling by Chinese standards. It’s twinned with Bolingbrook, Illinois. The economy is based on the local wig factories; Xuchang is known as China’s ‘capital of hair.’ Rebecca Hair Products, based in Xuchang, is the largest wigmaker in the world; most of their products are sold in Nigeria, Ghana, and the Congo. This capital of hair appeared to have absolutely nothing going on. A few old men fishing in the canals, but nowhere to eat, nowhere to drink, nowhere to sit and play mahjong, not even any <em>malls</em>, just housing. I imagined the workers coming home to these towers after a twelve-hour shift and simply <em>turning themselves off</em>. Geological and inhuman, crystal cities for mineral men weaving artificial hair. Eventually, though, I broke through the heavy ring of avenues and towers into the old heart of Xuchang, the place that was here before every Chinese city started exploding in size. Here, the buildings weren’t so tall, only six or seven storeys. There were shops and restaurants. It felt like an actual city. Western cities are built up in the centre and gradually fade to suburbs, but Chinese cities are all shaped like a bowl: huge towers surrounding a a low-rise core. As I walked further into the heart of Xuchang the mid-century apartment buildings were replaced by brick and concrete hovels, narrow piss-stinking alleyways, houses without glass in the windows, piles of garbage in the corners. Finally, I turned a corner to see that right at the very centre of Xuchang, there was an enormous statue of none other than Cao Cao.</p><p>It is weird to raise statues of Cao Cao: the man is not well liked. In Chinese, you don’t say <em>speak of the Devil</em> when someone you’re talking about suddenly appears, you say 说曹操 曹操到: <em>speak of Cao Cao, and Cao Cao comes</em>. When he was alive 1,800 years ago, Cao Cao was a poet and statesman who tried to hold the Han dynasty together during its final years. But various folklore traditions, culminating in the <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em>, have turned him into a mythic villain: a sneaky, scheming, manipulative, murderous tyrant. Most of the stories abou Cao Cao involve him using subterfuge to escape from an honest fight, murdering a subordinate to avoid blame for his own mistakes, or murdering people for essentially no reason whatsoever. A statue of Cao Cao in China is like a statue of Pharaoh in Israel, or Tarquin in Italy, or Cromwell in Ireland. Imagine finding, in the next town over from wherever you live, a big monument to Adolf Hitler. But Xuchang is different, because he <em>lived here</em>. In the year 196, Cao Cao moved the Emperor Xian to Xuchang and made the place his capital. This drab industrial town was once the seat of empires.</p><p>But that’s not because Xuchang is particularly <em>special</em>. I had options: instead of getting my train from there, I could have gone east from Nanjie and jumped on a train at Zhoukou, an even blander expanse of apartment blocks and factories. Zhoukou is a logistics hub for agricultural produce; the town is surrounded by refrigerated warehouses. As it happens, they’ve been doing this for a long time. Huge ancient granaries, four thousand years old, have been found here: this was the site of the earliest centralised grain stores in Chinese history. According to legend, Zhoukou is also where Fu Xi died. Fu Xi was the earliest of the Three Sovereigns, a serpent-bodied god who wrote the <em>I Ching</em> and also, as an afterthought, created the first men out of clay. From 1045-479 BC, Zhoukou was the capital of the state of Chen; everyone with the surname Chen can trace their origins here. One such person was a military officer named Chen Sheng, who sparked China’s first recorded peasant uprising in 209 BC. Chen had been heading to a planned rendezvous with the Qin Emperor, but he was trapped by heavy floods. He knew that the punishment for being late, however good his excuse might be, was death. He knew that the punishment for rebelling against the Emperor was also death. He decided to chance it. Chen set up his base in Zhoukou, and attempted to muster the support of the local people by writing the words <em>Chen Sheng is King</em> on a piece of silk and stuffing it in the stomach of a fish. This must have worked, because soon he was leading tens of thousands of hastily armed peasants into a series of battles, all of them brutal defeats. In the end, he was murdered by his own men. </p><p>Or I could have gone from Nanyang, which was once the capital of the three-thousand-year-old state of Shen. Or from Shangqiu, which has a major frozen-vegetable packaging plant, and which was also a prehistoric capital of the Shang dynasty. Or maybe Zhumadian, birthplace of the great Legalist philosopher Li Si, who effectively united China as Prime Minister of Qin, and also the great materialist philosopher Fan Zhen, who kept insisting that the soul was not immortal with lines like ‘the soul is to the body as sharpness is to a knife; if a knife is destroyed, how can its sharpness persist?’ until the devoutly Buddhist Emperor Wu of Liang begged him to stop and finally had him exiled. Other nearby train stations include a capital of China under eight dynasties, or the birthplace of the Yellow Emperor. <em>Everywhere</em> is like this. Every anonymous shithole was once the home of tyrants and gods. Every square inch of China is saturated in its past, and every year the Yellow River deposits another twelve months of silted time. The centuries pile up here. It’s a wonder anyone manages to breathe.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff96b8a94-8ed4-4b8a-bb34-34026f2ec211_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff96b8a94-8ed4-4b8a-bb34-34026f2ec211_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff96b8a94-8ed4-4b8a-bb34-34026f2ec211_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff96b8a94-8ed4-4b8a-bb34-34026f2ec211_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff96b8a94-8ed4-4b8a-bb34-34026f2ec211_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff96b8a94-8ed4-4b8a-bb34-34026f2ec211_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f96b8a94-8ed4-4b8a-bb34-34026f2ec211_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:429610,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff96b8a94-8ed4-4b8a-bb34-34026f2ec211_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff96b8a94-8ed4-4b8a-bb34-34026f2ec211_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff96b8a94-8ed4-4b8a-bb34-34026f2ec211_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff96b8a94-8ed4-4b8a-bb34-34026f2ec211_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>But wherever I got on the train, my destination was Qufu in Shandong province: the deeply boring birthplace of the deeply boring sixth century BC sage Kong Fuzi, who you might know as Confucius.</p><p>Qufu did not do it for me. I was strangely unimpressed by the enormous gaudy statue of the man himself, taller than Notre Dame Cathedral and finished only this year. I did not care for the largest Confucian temple in the world. I was secretly very bored by the cemetery, where the great sage is buried among many other tombs thousands of years old. Maybe I’m starting to burn out on classical Chinese architecture. Or maybe the problem is that I read the <em>Analects</em> on the train, and they left a bad taste in my mouth. Have you ever actually read the <em>Analects</em>? They are—and I’m not trying to needlessly insult the philosophical basis of one of the world’s great civilisations here, I’m really not, but my higher duty is always to the truth—they are absolute drivel. No maieutics, no attempts to prise under the surface of concepts, no critical <em>thought</em>. I genuinely cannot fathom why China, which has produced no end of brilliant thinkers and engagingly weird mystics, would choose to not just revere this pompous windbag, but to actually <em>worship</em> him. (Don’t ever let anyone tell you Confucianism isn’t a religion. In every temple there’s a huge statue of the man, and people come to bow down before it and leave it offerings of cookies and fruit.) Every single saying of Confucius is exactly the same: ‘When people do good things, this is good, but when people do bad things, this is bad indeed.’ A pedantic chronicle of banalities and tautologies, all delivered by some flatulent local politician as if they’re world-shattering insights. I know his type, old Kong Fuzi. I have seen him in the wild. Some middle-aged Home Counties bore, small businessman, Tory councillor, great avuncular font of unsolicited advice. Ask him about the economy, he’ll tell you. What it is, you see, is it’s all <em>supply and demand</em>. Go on, ask him any question about World War II. What other kind of person could have produced such magnificent insights as ‘If you are strict with yourself, your mistakes will be few,’ or ‘It is good when the good people like you, and the bad people dislike you,’ or ‘Skilful speech and flattering expressions are seldom indicative of true goodness?’ </p><p>To be fair to the man, Confucius never claimed to have invented anything <em>new</em>. He always insisted that all he’d ever done was pass on the wisdom and the virtue of the people who’d come before him. He just wanted people to know the classics. I, for one, believe him. The other side to Confucius, alongside the unbearable smug uncle, is the hysterical great-aunt, the one who shrieks as soon as you come within six feet of some hideous chintzy vase: ‘Don’t <em>touch</em> that! It’s <em>old</em>!!’ Confucius wants people to stop meddling and innovating and coming up with new ideas. The important thing is to express 仁, <em>ren</em>, benevolence, and the root of all benevolence is 孝, <em>xiao</em>: filial piety—in other words, total submission to the relics of the past, as embodied in your parents. ‘When your father is alive, observe his will. When your father is dead, observe his former actions. If for three years you do not change from the ways of your father, that can be called <em>xiao</em>.’ It’s not enough to <em>love</em> your old dad; you have to abstract him into a monstrous, undead regulative mechanism, a castrating demon that haunts you from the black lands beyond sleep. You don’t even need to drag out your Freud to explain this; there’s a clammy sheen of neurosis over every page. </p><p>Good government, Confucius says, depends on benevolent rulers. When the rulers are virtuous, the people will be virtuous too. (Absolute power is taken for granted; there’s never any question that the rulers must rule. His whole political universe is contained in four doubled characters. 君君臣臣父父子子: let rulers rule, ministers minister, fathers father, sons son.) But how do you make sure the rulers are worthy? Easy: you just make sure they perform the Zhou sacrificial rites—and thanks to the <em>Liji</em>, or the <em>Book of Rites</em>, we know exactly what those were. In a country of tiny plots that has been wracked by famine throughout its entire history, the rites consisted of continually giving rice and meat and wine to the spirits of your dead parents. Filial piety on the level of the state. The living must constantly labour to feed the dead; the old must eat the young. Sometimes literally: one of the most extreme forms of filial piety is the practice of 割股, <em>gegu</em>, in which sons and daughters would slice off strips of their own arms or thighs to feed their dying parents. Your flesh was never yours to begin with: it came from your parents, belongs to your parents; if they’re dying it’s because they gave too much of themselves away to an ingrate like you, and now you need to give it back. In every society—not least ours—the thoughtless rich have dreamed of immortality, but it’s nowhere such a cultural fixation as in China. Only in China is it an <em>affront to nature</em> that the old should die instead of the young. In the rest of the world, immortality means eternal youth. Here, the dream of immortality is the dream of infinite, indefinite old age. </p><p>Zi Zhang asked Confucius whether the state of affairs ten generations in the future could be known. Confucius replied: ‘Of course! The Shang built their propriety on that of the Xia. What was added and what was omitted is known. The Zhou built their propriety on that of the Shang. What was added and what was omitted is known. If there is ever another dynasty after the Zhou, even one hundred generations from now, it can already be known.’</p><p>Anyway, I think all this is the source of whatever it is that’s going on between the Chinese and the Jews. Because there’s definitely <em>something</em> going on. Chinese people seem to have a thing for Jews. They keep on making the comparison. Every time I’ve mentioned my Judaism here, I’ve heard that ah, Jews are smart, <em>like Chinese people</em>, Jews value good education, <em>like Chinese people</em>, Jews have a long history, <em>just like Chinese people</em>. And it must go the other way too, because we keep on marrying each other; as it happens, one such marriage is the reason I’m in China in the first place. Sometimes, Chinese philosemitism does take on weird forms. One of the most extraordinary things I’ve seen in this country is a big glossy book titled 犹太人 赚钱术, or <em>The Jewish Guide to Making Money</em>. As the introduction helpfully explains, a clandestine cabal of Jews—including such noted members of the tribe as Warren Buffett—secretly controls the entire world’s financial system. But instead of launching into the usual diatribe against these bloodsucking zio-parasites, this book just grins: Aren’t these Jews impressive? Don’t you want to be just like them? Each chapter even begins with a totally fabricated quote from the Talmud, in which the rabbis stress the importance of attracting loyal repeat customers and note that it’s easier to market to women. (Admittedly, some stuff is less friendly than <em>The Jewish Guide to Making Money</em>. In Chinese propaganda posters about Western spies, the spy in question always seems to have a big, hooked nose.) But beyond the weird money stuff, I think what we really have in common is our mutual neurosis before history, one that’s also wrapped up in a very specific guilt towards our parents. Like most Jews, I have a special box on the doorpost of my home, containing a special scroll that says ‘Put these words on the doorposts of your home.’ Like most Jewish men, I have a strip of scarified flesh just beneath the end of my penis. Why? Because it’s tradition! Because this is what we’ve always done! How many of my ancestors died for their meaningless Hebrew rituals? Who am I to reject this gift, handed down through so many generations, at the cost of so much blood? Did we really survive the Holocaust so the chain could end with <em>me</em>? This is a lot to lay on a kid, and a lot of us do reject the gift. Jews and Chinese have always been overrepresented among revolutionaries. In 231 BC, the Emperor Qin Shi Huang attempted to destroy the entire corpus of Confucian literature, clear out the monstrous wreckage of the past, wipe the slate clean. Hundreds of ancient texts were lost forever, and hundreds of scholars were buried alive, but it wasn’t enough. In the 1960s, the Red Guards tried to smash the Four Olds. In Qufu, they opened up the grave of Confucius’ most recent descendant and hung his corpse naked from a tree. Abolish the past! But that wasn’t enough either. Eventually, the vast muddy Chinese past healed over and abolished them. </p><p>But there’s a difference between Judaism and Confucianism. In Judaism, all this ritual and tradition surrounds a single transcendent idea that places itself outside of history: the oneness of God. Confucianism has no real equivalent. It’s a conservatism without content. Honour your parents: why? Because your parents are your ancestors; even while they’re still alive, they represent the world of the dead. Perform the sacrificial rites: why? Because the sacrificial rites ensure continuity with the past. I don’t think it makes sense to say that China is or has ever been a Confucian society, because Confucianism isn’t really anything by itself. The structure only makes sense in reference to something outside the structure. You could transplant the whole of Confucianism to Mesoamerica, and it’d be about the humane virtues of cutting out hearts for Tezcatlipoca. An English Confucius would grumble about where to put the beans in a fried breakfast. Confucius is a protective sheath around the past, a technology for ensuring the safe transmission, across vast stretches of time, of <em>something else</em>. </p><p>It’s hard to see that thing inside its bulky conveyance. Maybe you need to be mad. In his <em>Diary of a Madman</em>, Lu Xun, the founder of modern Chinese literature, describes leafing through the history of China. ‘There were no dates in this history, but scrawled this way and that across every page were the words BENEVOLENCE, RIGHTEOUSNESS and MORALITY. Since I couldn’t get to sleep anyway, I read that history very carefully for most of the night, and finally I began to make out what was written <em>between</em> the lines; the whole volume was filled with a single phrase: EAT PEOPLE!’</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e2644db-055b-4218-9e52-f32be5604b43_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e2644db-055b-4218-9e52-f32be5604b43_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e2644db-055b-4218-9e52-f32be5604b43_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e2644db-055b-4218-9e52-f32be5604b43_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e2644db-055b-4218-9e52-f32be5604b43_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e2644db-055b-4218-9e52-f32be5604b43_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0e2644db-055b-4218-9e52-f32be5604b43_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:312868,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e2644db-055b-4218-9e52-f32be5604b43_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e2644db-055b-4218-9e52-f32be5604b43_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e2644db-055b-4218-9e52-f32be5604b43_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e2644db-055b-4218-9e52-f32be5604b43_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I went looking for that <em>something else</em>. I’d already found scraps of it littered around China. Like at Dongyue Miao, a Taoist temple in Beijing. Before I came to China, I was only really acquainted with the mystic, ineffable, Ursula K Le Guin articulation of Taoism. As I soon discovered, this is not the only version. (Did you know that in some schools of Taoism, the Tao is so far from being abstract and unnameable that it can actually <em>manifest itself on Earth, walking around in human form</em>?) Dongyue is dedicated to the 76 heavenly departments of Mount Tai: a kind of supernatural bureaucracy that governs the affairs of this world and the punishments of Hell. Each department has its own little chapel, filled with lifesize plaster statues of penitent sinners and gibbering demons, each presided over by a stern and identical god. There’s the Department of Flying Birds, which ‘has the function of looking into the multiplication of the birds and their premature death.’ There’s the Department of Forest Ghosts and Spirits. There’s the Department of Jaundice, where someone had left a thick stack of mooncakes: maybe all the baiju had finally caught up with their liver and they were trying to curry favour. My favourite, though, was the Signature Department. ‘This department is the headquarters of all the signature departments in the nether world. Its function is to sign and approve documents or verdicts passed by the other departments prior to execution.’ Kafka imagined Poseidon as an Olympian administrator, ‘in the depths of the world-ocean, doing figures.’ In China, that’s the <em>actual religion</em>. This is because Taoism is an elaborate form of shamanism and animism, but unlike most animist peoples, the Chinese have spent five thousand years living under a highly sophisticated bureaucratic state. So social objects acquired the same numinous quality as natural objects; the teeming nameless spirits of the earth became the teeming nameless spirits of the imperial state. But the spirits are the same. They never became pantheons, like in the Indo-European or Mesoamerican religions. No agricultural dyads, no sky-fathers and earth-mothers. China still worships the oldest gods, the voices that whispered in the days of stone-tipped spears, when the world was cold and new.</p><p>But to really sink into the deep past of China, I had to go to Anyang.</p><p>Anyang is another ordinary industrial city in Henan province, just like Xuchang, Zhoukou, Nanyang, Shangqiu, and all the rest. It’s flat and muggy and dull, and the air tasted weird: for the first time in China, I was experiencing triple-digit AQIs. As I trundled down the street there, there wasn’t a single head that didn’t turn to stare at me as I passed. Not hostile, just amazed. What on earth could I possibly be doing here? Foreigners don’t come to Anyang. This place is grimy. It has a huge steelworks. It sits on potassium-bearing shales. Whenever the pollution clears enough to see, the skyline is dominated by huge smokestacks: old brick ones in the centre of town, new concrete ones on the outskirts. On the banks of the Anyang River, every breath you take is gritty with tiny flies. The most popular local delicacy is pig’s blood. Anyang is still the only place in China I’ve seen actual graffiti on the streets. Someone had scrawled an indignant message in Biro on the front of a shop. ‘Zou Yunshou, liar and scammer, will not come to a good end! Return our hard-earned money!’ There were a few old shipping containers seemingly abandoned in the scrubland by the waterfront, all labelled ‘Migrant worker dormitory.’ Each had a door cut into the side, with a plastic curtain, open just wide enough that I could hear the breathing and smell the stench of a few dozen men in tight-packed bunk beds, sleeping. Anyang has very bad vibes. But four thousand years ago, Anyang was the capital of the Shang, China’s oldest historic dynasty, which ruled from around 1600 to 1045 BC. Anyang is where we discovered the oracle bones.</p><p>I may have mentioned the oracle bones before in this series, but once you know about the oracle bones it’s hard to talk about anything else. These are the oldest known documents in written Chinese, and they give us an exhaustive and intimate account of court life. But unlike other early civilisations, the Shang didn’t appear to use their writing system to keep records or invoices, or to send letters, or even for monumental inscriptions. The earliest form of written Chinese was used exclusively to communicate with the gods. The oracle bones were divinatory instruments. The querent would carve a question into a piece of turtle shell or the shoulderblade of a bull, which would then be placed in a fire until it cracked. The pattern of cracks is your answer.</p><p>Oracle bone script is the direct ancestor of present-day Chinese characters. Unlike modern Chinese, it’s also entirely pictographic. The oracle bone script for <em>mountain</em> consists of three triangular peaks; this was eventually refined into the modern 山. A <em>person</em> was once a fully articulated stick figure; today he’s ended up with only his legs, as 人. My favourite oracle bone character is the one for elephant, which is just a little drawing of an elephant. Chinese writing is cobbled together out of the natural forms of the world, fortified by rebuses and puns. But what I find really fascinating about the oracle bones isn’t the system of symbols, but the <em>other</em> script: the crack in the shell. Early Chinese writing was only half of a language; the other half belonged to the natural world, or the gods, who wrote in fire and bone. Perhaps uniquely, the Shang-era Chinese held that the world itself was <em>literate</em>. Which might be why Chinese writing still uses ideographic elements today: these are not just conventional symbols; they’re the language of mimesis and similitude by which the world makes itself legible. You can write to it, and it write back.</p><p>But what it says is this: EAT PEOPLE!</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b167dc2-8b8c-482f-ab73-bad816543ae5_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b167dc2-8b8c-482f-ab73-bad816543ae5_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b167dc2-8b8c-482f-ab73-bad816543ae5_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b167dc2-8b8c-482f-ab73-bad816543ae5_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b167dc2-8b8c-482f-ab73-bad816543ae5_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b167dc2-8b8c-482f-ab73-bad816543ae5_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6b167dc2-8b8c-482f-ab73-bad816543ae5_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:704071,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b167dc2-8b8c-482f-ab73-bad816543ae5_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b167dc2-8b8c-482f-ab73-bad816543ae5_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b167dc2-8b8c-482f-ab73-bad816543ae5_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b167dc2-8b8c-482f-ab73-bad816543ae5_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I knew before I came that the Shang practiced human sacrifice. I knew that the oracle bones repeatedly spoke about offering burned or beheaded men to the ancestors, drowning women, beating people to death in the temples, cooking people in cauldrons, sprinkling their blood on the altars. I knew that oracle bone caches were often sited near mass graves. Still, I wasn’t really prepared for the ruins of the Shang capital of Yinxu in Anyang. The archaeologists had excavated the graves to reveal the human corpses piled up inside—and then they had simply <em>left them there</em>, left the bones in these square pits like newly dug graves, with just a perspex roof to protect them from the elements. A few ice cream wrappers and cigarette ends had slipped down the sides: new grave goods for the sacrifices of the second millennium BC. The entire landscape was riddled with these plastic coffins, these earthen pits, these human bones. I thought about the terrible fear those people must have felt in their final moments. And as I stared at the bones, time started to slip. I’d been reading Ma Jian’s novel <em>China Dream</em>, a fairly heavy-handed satire about a corrupt CPC functionary who loses the ability to distinguish between past and present. His daily life is continually invaded by visions of the Cultural Revolution. When he opens a new business park he’s suddenly aware that he’s standing over the bones of his own parents. They’d killed themselves after being criticised and beaten by the Red Guards. He had denounced them as evil rightists for owning a pair of Italian leather shoes. Now all the bones start coming to the surface, and as he’s inaugurating the prosperous new China of the future he keeps slipping into the past. ‘Fifty years ago this place was a mass grave filled with nameless bodies, but today it is a Garden Square on which we celebrate golden anniversaries!’ In Anyang, I was no longer sure which century these bodies were from. From the Shang to the Red Guards, all of history is just living bodies going in the ground, stuffing the earth full of its own fruit. The country of the dead has no chronology.</p><p>It was Qin Shi Huang, the murderous tyrant who wanted to wipe out all of Chinese culture, that first tried to ban the practice of human sacrifice. All through the Zhou dynasty, the Spring and Autumn period, and the Warring States era—one of the high water marks of classical Chinese humanism—rich people would feed their ancestors on human flesh. All the rites that Confucius held in such high esteem, the ones that would make people just and wise and benevolent, descended from the slaughter of human sacrifices. And according to a researcher and possible crackpot called Gang Xu, even his concept of <em>ren</em>, benevolence, comes with the bloodstains of a deeper past. The character for <em>benevolence</em>, 仁, consists of a version of 人, the character for <em>person</em>, plus 二, the number two. Benevolence is what should govern whenever two people come together. But in the oracle bones it has a different shape. As I’ve mentioned, 人 appears in the oracle bones as a stick figure; the character that would end up becoming <em>shi</em>, 尸, was nearly identical, but it showed the knees bent and the arms slightly drooping. 尸 is the word for a dead body, and in bone and bronze inscriptions continuing well after the end of the Shang dynasty, the word 仁 is rendered not with 人 but with 尸. Benevolence is a pile of corpses. Gang Xu, who claims to be on the run from shadowy oppressors who will almost certainly murder him some time soon, also claims that when Confucius defines <em>benevolence</em> as ‘to overcome oneself and return to the rituals,’ the word 克, <em>overcome</em>, is better translated as <em>kill</em>. The concept of benevolence originally referred to a ritual in which a nobleman would heroically—and not always for any particular reason—sacrifice his own life. A gift to the sovereigns of death, who always have right on their side. In literary Chinese, the word for martyrdom is 成仁, literally <em>to honour benevolence</em>.</p><p>Small shards of this notion are dispersed throughout Chinese history. In 1644, during the innumerable wars that marked the transition between Ming and Qing, a peasant warlord named Zhang Xianzhong seized the province of Sichuan. By the time he was forced out by Manchu armies in 1646, maybe less than a quarter of the province’s population was left alive. Zhang had his followers massacre the local population; when there was nobody left he had them kill each other. He murdered his servants and his lovers and his childhood friends. He liked to disassemble human bodies, building mountains of ears and noses, pyramids of skulls. When he recovered from an illness, he celebrated by killing thousands of women, cutting off their feet, and piling them into two ‘heavenly candles,’ which he then set alight. Each candle was crowned with a foot from his favourite concubine. One persistent legend says that he raised an obelisk in the wasteland he’d created, like an artist’s signature, to explain why he’d done it. He also understood the arguments of the old gods. It’s known as the Seven Kill Stele:</p><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text">天生萬物以養人

Mesopotamia is older, and it’s not even close: the first Sumerian cuneiform texts were written more than two thousand years before the oracle bones. But while whatever it is that calls itself the West sometimes claims to have been born in the valley of the Euphrates, we’ve inherited almost nothing from that world. The division of a circle into 360 degrees; a few scraps of astrology. We couldn’t even read their writing until the 1830s. Our civilisation is one with amnesia. In 1925, a British archaeologist discovered an incredible trove of ancient objects near the site of Ur; what was strange about them, though, was that they were all from different eras, sometimes thousands of years apart—and some of these artefacts were clay tablets that appeared to be describing the others. He had unearthed a <em>museum</em>. Ennigaldi-Nanna, daughter of the last of the neo-Babylonian king, had dug up these forgotten objects from across the empire and exhibited them, but then her state collapsed and they were buried and forgotten again. The <em>Epic of Gilgamesh</em> was <em>the</em> great Mesopotamian narrative, as foundational to that society as Shakespeare or the Bible is to ours, continually rewritten in both Sumerian and Akkadian for thousands of years. But for thousands of years after that, only the faintest echo survived. In his <em>De Natura Animalium</em>, Aelian tells the story of a King Gilgamos who was thrown out of a tower as a baby and rescued by a passing eagle. Arabic grimoires make passing mention of a desert spirit called Jiljamish: a demon.</p><p>China is different. China remembers itself. A few weeks ago, I bought a jade disc from an antiques market. This design is called a 璧, or <em>bi</em>. The first known <em>bi</em> were produced by the Hongshan culture in northern China nearly six thousand years ago, deep in prehistory. But objects based on the exact same pattern have been made in every single Chinese civilisation since. There are intricately patterned <em>bi</em> from the Shang dynasty and eighteenth-century <em>bi</em> covered in gaudy animals and cheap plastic <em>bi</em> to decorate your Airbnb. The same goes for the 琮 or <em>cong</em>, a square vessel with a circular hole: also first made six thousand years ago, also manufactured consistently ever since. The very earliest prehistoric cultures in the central plains of China appear to have venerated dragons, worshipped ancestors, and made sacrifices in three-legged cauldrons.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> Imagine if French artists had continually reworked themes from the Lascaux cave paintings for the entire span of recorded history. Imagine finding evidence, in an archaeological site somewhere near Paris, for a form of prehistoric parkour.</p><p>I mentioned all this to an expat here, and he shrugged. ‘You buy all that continuity stuff, do you?’ he said. Maybe he has a point. Maybe, given my political and intellectual background, I should be looking for all the points of disjuncture and non-identity in Chinese history, the <em>différance</em> that separates every instant from itself. I’m usually very eager to point out that the ancient pagan folk customs of Europe are just nineteenth-century inventions. Usually I’m full of scorn for the people who think they’re part of a Great Tradition, when actually they’re just ordinary capitalist subjects cobbling together a deranged racial mythology out of stuff they learned from videogames. Here, the state does the same thing; it loves to gush over the extraordinary continuity of Chinese civilisation. Just before I arrived in China, President Xi went to Anyang himself to look at the oracle bones and deliver a major speech on China’s spiritual civilisation. ‘Without the 5,000 years of Chinese civilisation,’ he said, ‘how could we have Chinese characteristics? Without the Chinese characteristics, how could we be on such a successful path of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era?’ For five thousand years, the Chinese people have been diligently progressing towards Xi Jinping Thought and the high-speed train. But this is only one way of looking at things. The other is to observe that China is a <em>prehistoric stone age civilisation</em> <em>that has persisted into the modern world.</em> A cultural coelacanth; a secret cousin to the Andaman Islands and the last uncontacted tribes in the jungles. It’s not that China is more <em>backwards</em> than the rest of the world, just that in China everything new—Buddhism, historical materialism, the smartphone, space travel—is integrated into a structure that has been in place for a very, very long time. This structure has survived every revolution. It has not died with any dynasty. It’s the hidden guest at every dinner. It’s the hidden room in every home. It appears to feed off human life. </p><p>When did this guest arrive? I said earlier that the Shang were China’s first historical dynasty, but according to the traditional account, there was one before them. The <em>Bamboo Annals</em> and the <em>Book of Documents</em> and the <em>Records of the Great Historian</em> and every other classical Chinese source all describe how the Shang only came to power after an uprising that overthrew the vastly more ancient Xia. But since the rise of the Doubting Antiquity School in the early twentieth century, it’s been assumed that the Xia were fabricated by the Zhou when they overthrew the Shang, to provide a precedent for the passing of the Mandate of Heaven. The Xia don’t <em>sound</em> particularly real. Their first ruler was a mythological hydraulic engineer called Great King Reptile, who spent thirteen years draining the waters of the Great Flood. The Xia kings reigned in the days when there were ten suns in the sky, burning the earth, until the archer Hou Yi shot nine of them down. For this, the gods rewarded him with two doses of the elixir of immortality: one for himself, and one for his wife, Chang’e. When bandits broke into their house looking for the elixir, Chang’e swallowed them both and rose into the sky to become the goddess of the moon. Later, Hou Yi was murdered by his friend Han Zhou, who set about killing the entire Xia royal family and usurpring their titles—all except one infant prince, raised in secret, who would one day restore their rightful rule… So for a while, archaeologists were content to dismiss the Xia as a myth. But they kept digging up Neolithic sites located around where the Xia would have had their cities, dated to the time when they would have ruled. For now, international researchers mostly ascribe these sites to the Erlitou culture, named after one site just south of Anyang. Chinese researchers are less cautious. As far as they’re concerned, these people <em>were</em> the Xia. This is not likely to ever be confirmed, since the Erlitou culture—being a prehistoric culture—didn’t give us any names of kings to compare with the histories, or any written documents at all.</p><p>Except that maybe they did. Erlitou ceramics are inscribed with dozens of weird marks and geometric symbols. These are called <em>proto-writing</em>, but some of them look a lot like Chinese characters. The same goes for the weird marks and geometric symbols produced by the Longshan culture, and the Liangzhu culture, and the Dawenkou culture, all the way back to the Jiahu symbols, found in a tiny cramped field in Henan province, just south of Xuchang where my journey began. The Jiahu symbols are more than eight thousand years old; older than the Vinča-Turdaș signs of pre-Indo-European Europe, older than the undeciphered script of the Harappan civilisation in the Indus Valley, and three times older than the oracle bones. But just like the Shang oracles, the Jiahu symbols were carved into turtle shells and ox bones, and just like the oracle script, the Jiahu symbols can be understood. One of them is clearly an eye. Another is a representation of the sun. A mouth. A scorpion. The figure of a man. It seems pointless to argue over whether or not the Jiahu symbols ‘count’ as a true writing. No, they’re not true writing, that’s the whole point: they’re so primitive, so close to the natural significations, that you can <em>read</em> them without having to read. It’s similarly pointless to dispute whether or not they’re an incredibly early ancestor of Chinese. All Chinese characters began as pictograms, images of the things they represented, which is why it’s inevitable that some Jiahu symbols will be exactly the same as the symbols on the oracle bones, five thousand years later. They come from the same source, which is the world. But one thing I can’t explain is the tight feeling of horror I felt in my chest when I saw the ordering of the Jiahu symbols on a strip of bone. A mouth. A figure of a man. A mouth. A figure of a man. A mouth. </p><p>According to the classical histories, the ultimate ancestor of the Xia dynasty was Zhuanxu, the Black Emperor. It was the Black Emperor who separated the earth from Heaven, so the gods would remain above and the people would remain below. He introduced the sacrificial rites. He instituted the Celestial Empire. According to the <em>Spring and Autumn Annals</em>, he also came from the Right Wall of the Purple Forbidden Enclosure: the binary star system Alpha Draconis, three hundred light years away. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0ba9daa-6688-44e4-94a5-532de57cad92_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0ba9daa-6688-44e4-94a5-532de57cad92_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0ba9daa-6688-44e4-94a5-532de57cad92_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0ba9daa-6688-44e4-94a5-532de57cad92_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0ba9daa-6688-44e4-94a5-532de57cad92_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0ba9daa-6688-44e4-94a5-532de57cad92_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b0ba9daa-6688-44e4-94a5-532de57cad92_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:310040,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0ba9daa-6688-44e4-94a5-532de57cad92_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0ba9daa-6688-44e4-94a5-532de57cad92_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0ba9daa-6688-44e4-94a5-532de57cad92_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0ba9daa-6688-44e4-94a5-532de57cad92_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Tomorrow, I will wake up in Inner Mongolia and get on a train to Beijing. The next day, I will fly from Beijing to Warsaw, the day after that I will fly from Warsaw to London. I’m sure it will feel very strange to be home, after two months melting my brain in Chinas real and imagined. It will feel strange to be in a city where I can understand what everyone’s saying and they can understand me. It will feel strange to be in a country where the newspapers contain actual news, and not just a gurgling appreciation of every speech the head of government makes. It will feel strange to be in grotty, declining old England again, where we can’t afford one measly high-speed rail line, where every year leaves us a little bit worse off, where we are poised to inherit nothing, where we have nowhere left to go.</p><p>I love China. I love this place and its people and its madness. It’s a beautiful place. It has wonderful, heroic, generous, brilliant people. There is also something very badly <em>wrong</em> about this country, something plainly <em>evil</em> buried deep in its past and grasping into its future. A thing that everyone knows but nobody will mention. I love that too. There is something very badly wrong with everywhere, and my own country is no exception. There is something very badly wrong with the world. One day, I’m sure, that evil will eat us all. But until then, we must love the world, and live.</p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>The best argument, I think, would go like this. Everyone knows that China has occasionally been ruled by steppe peoples, Mongols and Manchus, but sometimes when they left they took China with them. When Genghis Khan invaded China, the first Chinese state he conquered was the Jin dynasty, and the Jin emperors were Jurchens, pastoral nomads from the northern steppe. The Jin had come to power after overthrowing the Liao dynasty, whose emperors were Khitans, another group of pastoral nomads from the northern steppe. After the destruction of Liao, a group of Khitan nobles fled west into Central Asia; they carved out a state there called Qara Khitai that extended from the Gobi Desert to the Aral Sea. Qara Khitai was a deeply weird state. Its rulers were Tunguskic, the population were mostly Turks, but all government was carried out exclusively in Chinese. The khans of Qara Khitai still issued seals and kept jade ornaments and observed the Confucian rites, and still insisted that they were actually the Emperors of China. <em>Cathay</em>, the early-modern name for China in Europe, comes from the Turkish pronunciation of <em>Khitai</em>. Eventually, Qara Khitai was obliterated by the Mongols—but in the chaos, a Khitan prince called Buraq Hajib fled even further west, and ended up founding a state in what’s now southwestern Iran that still claimed to be China.</p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-2" href="#footnote-anchor-2" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">2</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>There were also some very <em>different</em> cultures in what’s now China. To take just one example, prehistoric Sichuan had the very freaky Sanxingdui culture: big monumental heads with snail-like protruding eyes. The Sanxingdui may have survived into the 4th century BC as the state of Shu, centred on Chengdu, until it was conquered by Qin. Any remnants of the local culture surviving under a Han Chinese superstrate would have been wiped out in the seventeenth century when Zhang Xianzhong destroyed the local population and Sichuan was repopulated by people from neighbouring provinces.</p></div></div>

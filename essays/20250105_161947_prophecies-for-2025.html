I go up there for you, to hear the future on the wind. But whenever I descend from the mountain with new prophecies for the coming year, it’s to a bunch of miserable complaints from you lot. Apparently, my prophecies ‘aren’t accurate.’ Apparently, I’m just ‘making up things that sound interesting with no actual vatic quality.’ Apparently I’m ‘outperformed by every prediction market going plus a bunch of supposedly psychic aquarium creatures.’ The evidence is that <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/prophecies-for-2023">in 2023</a> I predicted that Donald Trump would die, and he didn’t, and then <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/prophecies-for-2024">in 2024</a> I predicted that the US election would be won by <em>nobody</em>, and it wasn’t. ‘The 2024 election,’ I wrote, ‘will simply <em>never end</em>. The rallies and debates and frenzied arguments will continue past November, through all of 2025, and out the other end.’ I’m told the Democrats are still fundraising as if there’s something at stake, but everyone else has agreed that there was in fact a winner, and it was Donald Trump. Meanwhile, I predicted that the Tories would somehow win the general election in the UK, which they didn’t, and that 2024 would feature some major act of fuckery by the Dutch, which they’ve managed to keep well hidden. It’s got to the point where I can’t so much as descend from my mountain without a mob of furious peasants braying unintelligibly at me while pointing at various misshapen vegetables whose advent I apparently failed to foresee. </p><p>I refuse to apologise. You haven’t been up on the mountain; I have. My prophecies are perfect. You live beneath the clouds, and you simply haven’t understood.</p><p>Take my election prophecy. Yes, I said that ‘Trump and Biden are the perma-candidates in the Forever Election; they’ll probably still be the perma-candidates long after their physical bodies have died.’ (I did correctly predict a Trump victory in September, but that doesn’t count.) Isn’t it weird, though, that the best part of a prophecy supposedly about how immovable Trump and Biden are was instead devoted to <em>Kamala Harris</em>? In the depths of last winter, I somehow had a vision of the Brat Summer that was coming. This is how prophecy works. There are wheels within wheels here; it takes a subtle reader to look past the overt content and see how I was actually completely right all along. Most readers are not subtle readers. But I think <em>you</em> might be. I don’t know how I can tell, but I have this strange sense that you’re better and smarter than the dumb pigs who read my prophecies. You see what’s really going on. You aren’t fooled by the surfaces of things…</p><p>If you need any more evidence, though, I’ll just point out that one year ago I wrote that while AI wouldn’t replace literary prose, it would start replacing ordinary conversation. ‘Increasingly, your messages to your group chat will be written by AI. The machines will communicate for everyone in the same friendly, even tone, and everyone’s group chat will contain the same roster of mildly funny memes. You will look at them and feel nothing, and push a button to generate your response.’ Apple is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deNzYrTvqCs">now advertising my nightmares as a nifty new feature</a>. I prophesied that all the Simone Weil-inflected flirtation with religious dogma had reached a cultural saturation point and we’d be heading back towards a kind of resurgent Even Newer Atheism, and last year the Grey Tribe scored its first act of spectacular public violence, which is basically a Bar Mitzvah for ideologies. (More on that later.) I prophesied that the new alternative media would start to recede, and everything would return to being consolidated around a few big mainstream outlets, and this has turned out truer than I ever imagined: in fact, this year’s most lively topic of debate on Substack, the home of lively debate, is <a href="https://thepointmag.substack.com/p/becca-rothfeld-and-sam-kahn-on-substack">how much worse</a> Substack is than traditional magazine publishing. </p><p>If the overt meanings of last year’s prophecies were sometimes confusing, though, it can only be because I arrived at them in part through a three-card Tarot draw. I saw the year unfold in the Hermit, the Page of Pentacles, and the King of Pentacles. But the Tarot is a subtle instrument, and reading it requires digging through many strata of meaning, all of them obscure. Maybe you need a clearer, more scientific approach. Luckily, we have one. </p><p>The year 2025 was born on January 1st, 2025, which makes it a Capricorn. Capricorn is an Earth sign, grounded, plodding, materialistic; one of the draught animals of the Zodiac. It’s under the rulership of Saturn: the melancholy king at the edge of space, who sets the limit and imposes the law, god of age and time. The obvious conclusion is that 2025 will not be a year of revolutions. We’ll see more reactionary retrenchment, more state crackdowns, more grey normality over the earth. The only problem is that <em>every</em> year is a Capricorn, since they all begin in early January. 1789 was a Capricorn; 1968 was a Capricorn. The numbered calendar year is always a Capricorn because the numbered calendar year is a bureaucratic imposition on the wild flows of time. Fortunately, we’re not limited to sun sign astrology, but the planets all seem to be telling the same story. 2025 was born at midnight on Caroline Island in Kiribati, an uninhabited atoll that happens to be the first patch of land after the International Date Line. This puts the Moon in 2025’s sixth house: it’ll be a humble, housebound year, sickly, mildly feeble. There might not be another pandemic, but it’ll feel like there is. Venus is in the seventh house, the House of Balance. This year will be dowdy, unsexy; not necessarily unfulfilling but basically passionless. A cultural trend away from both expressive blue-haired perversion and frothing inceldom, towards a generally neutral erotic stasis. Mars is in the twelfth house: the sector of the sky reserved for dreams, mystery, the shadow, the unthinking parts of the mind. There will be secret wars. Nameless conflicts fought underground. The same goes for the culture war: you will no longer know what to call your enemy, or even what side you yourself are on. </p><p>But I know, because I’ve heard it on the mountain. This is what I can tell you about your year:</p><h4>Politics is already over</h4><p>Two big things allegedly happened while I was away. Firstly, the Assad regime in Syria—which had survived over thirteen years of civil war, clawing back almost all its former territory inch by shell-blasted inch—completely collapsed in a rebel offensive that barely lasted a week. During the middle of the offensive, the CEO of a major American health insurance firm was assassinated in broad daylight in New York. The alleged killer turned out to be a handsome and charming twenty-six-year-old with sexy eyebrows and an impressive physique, and he became an instant folk hero. Crowds cheer Luigi Mangione as he’s paraded into a courtroom. Crowds wave revolutionary flags in the old centre of Damascus. Some of them are dressed like SpongeBob SquarePants. Everything seems fluid again. Politics is back; history is back; big mass energies are being unleashed, the world can be overthrown in an instant… </p><p>I’m not so sure. Last year, I prophesied that one single political event, the US presidential election, would not happen. This time, I may as well go double or quits. <em>There will be absolutely no political events whatsoever in 2025</em>.</p><p>I think this is actually a fairly reasonable prediction, since basically everything that passes for politics turns out to be something else. Look at Syria. How did the regime fall so fast? The government forces that had held the state together by killing maybe half a million of its citizens seemed to suddenly dissolve into nothing. There was no great last stand, not even in the capital, not even in the Alawite regions along the coast. The chemical weapons stayed in their silos. No cities pounded into rubble. No long gruelling battles. The entire country was won and lost with only a few hundred casualties on each side. The reason the regime fell so quickly is that <em>there was no regime</em>. Bashar al-Assad might have lingered around his palace in Damascus, a great gormless national ghost, but his government was essentially overthrown maybe a decade ago. Syria was <em>actually</em> governed by an intricate feudal patchwork of local militia, armed tribes, mafia groups, religious orders, narco gangs, reconciled rebels, and foreign actors. All of these ruled their own minor fiefdoms through various forms of extortion, criminality, and terror, but the only ones with any real military capacity were the foreign actors. In 2024, Iran and Hezbollah had bigger problems than the fate of the world’s biggest captagon factory, and pulled out. The wave that followed wasn’t really an offensive in any conventional sense. All these local fiefs simply changed the patches on their camo jackets. Before, they had been sitting in plastic chairs, smoking and collecting bribes while calling themselves the Syrian Arab Army. Now, they’re doing it while calling themselves the Syrian Salvation Government. There’s one fewer Damascene with a head like a toilet brush, and one more in Moscow. Aside from that, essentially nothing has changed. </p><p>Syria is the model for everything that will appear to happen in 2025. There will be no events. There will be no shifts. The entire discourse of politics will spiral into irrelevance. What you will get, though, are various versions of an amphetamine gang sewing new patches onto their shirts. </p><p>There was a very palpable disappointment from dead-end political commentators when the mystery health insurance assassin was finally named as Luigi Mangione, because Mangione’s politics were seemingly impossible to place. He liked Joe Rogan, the notion of masculinity, and <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, but he also disliked climate change, Jordan Peterson, and, clearly, the private healthcare system. According to his Goodreads, he’d read the Unambomber manifesto, but given it a lukewarm four-star review. Meanwhile, he gave five stars to something called <em>The Bullet Journal Method: Track the Past, Order the Present, Design the Future</em>. He appears to have been the only person ever radicalised into violence by TED talks. The consensus is that Mangione’s politics were <em>incoherent</em>: he took bits and pieces from various systems of thought and combined them into a misshapen ideological golem of his own design. But his politics were perfectly coherent, they just weren’t a politics.</p><p>What Mangione ultimately believed in was an ideology of <em>personal optimisation</em>. This is what’s left after all politics have been exhausted, the 2010s left and the 2020s right. There’s still the relentless need to improve <em>something</em>, but it’s no longer directed outwards. As we’ve discovered, another world is not actually possible, but there are ways to live better in this one. You can cut down on caffeine and pornography, organise your notebooks, work out more efficiently at the gym, and listen to podcasts that nourish your brain instead of numbing it. Collective action is foreclosed, but there’s still time to get on a good nootropics stack. None of this is incoherent; it makes perfect sense. It makes sense to limit your focus to the things you can change. Or when you lift your gaze to the world at large again, it makes sense to consider all social conflicts as engineering problems. There are blockages in the free flow of smart ideas that prevent systems from running optimally. Some of those blockages can be cleared with the right information, or with mosquito nets. Some of them can be cleared with bullets. </p><p>This Tim Urbanism-Andrew Hubermanism is not the only nonpolitical ideology circulating. There’s a closely related variant that encourages you to get into massive debt buying crypto and bad art. There was one that prescribed moral self-improvement via polyamory, weight gain, and pop music; somehow, this managed to pass itself off as ‘leftism’ for the best part of a decade. Whatever its flavour, though, the real name for this ideology is <em>hysteria</em>. All this <em>working on yourself</em>, approaching your own self like a raw material in the production process—who am I? who am I?—means looking at yourself from the outside, through the eyes of someone or something else. The actual question: who am I <em>to you</em>? The trace of some shapeless, nameless, unidentifiable Other, the one you do it for, the one who would finally be able to tell you what you are. </p><p>People are tired of politics, not because politics has become <em>too hysterical</em>, but because in an age of stasis and patch-switching, politics is no longer an effective framework for their hysteria. It’s no longer satisfying to answer the question <em>who am I to the other</em> with a load of culture-war blather. Now, even political terrorism can become a form of self-improvement. In 2025, the new apoloticism will colonise even more beloved, old-fashioned political forms. The second Donald Trump presidency will be dominated by a kind of apolitical populism, directed more against seed oils and xenoestrogens than imports, migrants, or the liberal classes. (The end of last year saw a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyv7gxp02yo">minor civil war</a> within the MAGA movement over the H1B visa. On one side, a lingering residue of mawkish reactionaries who genuinely thought Trump would send all the foreigners home; on the other, Trump’s new coterie of fundamentally apolitical Silicon Valley solutionists, with firms powered by migrant labour. As always, the people who believe in politics will lose.) There will be apolitical conspiracy theories again. Fewer references to how <em>they</em> are secretly planning to destroy your life; more cryptids, UFOs, lost continents. Instead of unbearable scolds fretting about books and films that don’t express the right political values, you’ll see unbearable scolds fretting about books and films that don’t encourage personal growth. Some countries on the periphery of the empire might experience an apolitical civil war. One year from now, you will realise with a dazed alarm that you didn’t even argue about politics over the Thanksgiving table. You just bickered about the polyunsaturates in the food.</p><h4>Get ready for the Objects Cinematic Universe</h4><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Of the ten highest-grossing films of 2024, nine were sequels, franchises, or adaptations of existing intellectual property. <em>Dune 2</em>. <em>Venom 3</em>. <em>Kung Fu Panda 4</em>. The only exception is a Chinese film called <em>YOLO</em>, which is about a shutin who learns to go outside. What an exciting time for the seventh art! Still, it’s clear that something has changed here. Mass culture used to belong to the super-franchises, sprawling cinematic universes that spat out one tedious new traumatised superhero every three weeks. The Disney-Marvel-industrial complex crawled over global culture like an enormous, sticky four-year-old, knocking things over, scribbling on the walls, until the entire planet was coated in a sticky residue and a scattering of half-sucked toys. That era is over, but nothing new has emerged to replace it. So we’re in a holding pattern. Hollywood just keeps everything running on a low simmer. They’re making <em>Venom 4</em>. They’re hard at work on <em>Kung Fu Panda 5</em>. It’s easy to blame all of this on the studios. Somehow, the job of making films has gone to people who don’t seem particularly interested in making films. They’d rather perform sweatshop labour: performing the same action over and over again, all day, every day. But to be honest, the real culprits here are you, the viewers. You didn’t <em>have</em> to watch <em>Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire</em>. Nobody forced you to go and see the remake of <em>Mean Girls</em> or the remake of <em>Wonka</em> or a back-to-basics <em>Alien</em> movie that repeats the original without being nearly as good. You can’t have good art without a good audience, and the audiences are awful. The only thing you’re looking for is the comfort of a familiar, repetitive experience. You want art to make you feel cosy and safe. Instead of a hundred billion dollar industry, you could get the same experience by rigging up the mechanism in a metronome to gently thwack you with a paddle every three seconds. You disgust me. </p><p>The problem is that there are only so many familiar cinematic experiences to repeat. The present franchises don’t leave much room for growth; 2024’s big innovation was the <em>necrosequel</em>, in which a generally beloved film from decades ago is dug up, dusted off, and saddled with an entirely unnecessary second half. <em>Gladiator II </em>came out twenty-four years after <em>Gladiator</em>. <em>Twisters</em> came out twenty-eight years after <em>Twister</em>. <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> arrived <em>thirty-six years</em> after the first instalment. These films do not have any illusions about their purpose. You know that bit in <em>Gladiator</em> when Russell Crowe says that ‘what we do in life echoes in eternity?’ It echoes in the sequel: you get to hear that line again as a ghostly voiceover, three or four times, for no very clear reason. They say ‘there was once a dream that was Rome’ again too. This sort of thing will sustain the industry for a while. All your favourite films will get découpéd into sequels. How about <em>Eight Samurai</em>? Why not <em>9½</em>? Let’s make a <em>Citizen Kane 2</em>, in which it turns out that Kane was also sentimental about another childhood toy. Maybe some kind of hoop. But there are a finite number of old films to cannibalise. What else?</p><p>There is one promising option. Back in 2023, Mattel successfully adapted its line of Barbie dolls into a po-faced Oscar-winning feature about the crisis of masculinity. Since it’s now impossible to do anything only once, there are more films lined up based on more of their branded products. A Barney the Dinosaur movie, which will apparently be a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/04/barney-the-dinosaur-film-daniel-kaluuya">dark and mature</a> take on millennial angst. A Polly Pocket movie, which will probably be about eating disorders. A Hot Wheels movie. An Uno movie. A Magic 8 Ball movie. This looks like a very solid seam of potential content. But why should it just be toy manufacturers that get to cash in? Starting in 2025, you’ll see the first stirrings of what I’m calling the Objects Cinematic Universe. Get ready for <em>Sellotape: The Movie</em>. What’s it about? It’s about sticking together. It’s about how somethimes in life things are torn, or smashed, or broken: like a relationship, like a family. But it’s also about how a little roll of adhesive tape can still hold everything together. You people will march in droves to see <em>Heinz’s Tomato Ketchup</em>, a melancholy two-and-a-half-hour epic about trauma and the frustrated dreams of youth. You’ll come out the cinema chattering about how it was actually surprisingly deep and meaningful, for a ketchup advert. You will feel no shame as you sit down for <em>The</em> <em>IKEA Billy Bookcase Movie</em> (a romcom) or <em>Dyson Gen5detect Cordless Vacuum Cleaner 2: Rise of the Dusterions</em> (action scifi) or <em>Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones - Aqua Blue</em> (a coming-of-age story). </p><p>With everything happening in the world, you can no longer afford any of these actual products, not even the tomato ketchup. The supermarket own-brand version isn’t as good, but we all need to scrimp and save wherever we can. You’ll still pay to see the movie, though; nobody can live without their entertainments. Gradually, the world of commodities will collapse into a world of commodity-branded media products. The last remaining industry will consist of supplying you with warm, cosy audiovisual sensations. Maybe, as the factories all close, some non-consumer-facing sectors might have to make a similar leap. There might be films based on a tungsten screw, or a conductive polymer hybrid aluminium electrolytic capacitor, or the ladle furnace at the world’s most medium-sized steelworks. These things no longer have any function except as the raw materials for our dreams. But even the full product of our planet-consuming techno-industrial apparatus is finite. Our demand for mediocre entertainment pap is not. What else can Hollywood consume, before it’s forced to start coming up with original ideas again?</p><p>I think the final stage will be films based on just ordinary stuff. Things you see by the side of the road. You might end up watching the film adaptation of a particularly interesting rock. Maybe studios will start a bidding war over the rights to a pile of fallen leaves, or a grey circle of ancient chewing gum, or a dead pigeon. Maybe a mountain could be IP, or a rainstorm, or an individual raindrop. To be clear, I think this is an entirely good thing. Once it’s in full swing, the Objects Cimematic Universe will mark a return to the purity of very early cinema. The first films were attempts to represent a single object through the medium of light and time. The Lumière brothers showed us a cabbage, a garden, a steam train: the spinning wheels of the train, the spinning wheels of the projector, spinning together, producing one eternal image. That train pulled into a station in the south of France one hundred and twenty years ago. It’s still arriving now. This is what a pure cinema can do, but along the way the form got muddled up with a load of unnecessary dross. Original stories, plots and characters, ideas. Finally, movies are growing out of all of that stuff. Maybe in 2025, cinema can become a genuine art. </p><h4>AI video will get worse</h4><p>Speaking of the eternal image, though—we are currently in the last phase of the golden age of AI video, and you don’t even realise it.</p><p>We’ve been here before. Five years ago, the early language models were producing bizarre, dreamlike strings of deeply gnomic text, and they were beautiful. If you asked them to produce, say, a recipe, you’d end up with an absurdist masterpiece. ‘CHEESE IN SILENCE: Heat oil in an inch-sized heat. Carefully layer fine wols of moose meat on the wine-pucked of the custard. Season with piss and pepper. Grate on a sharp sharp sharp sharp sha sha Mary Onf Kacthler - Vegetarian Grundling.’ When ChatGPT was foisted on us two years ago, I spent about a week playing with the thing, getting it to generate a version of <em>Hamlet</em> about toothpaste and mean Donald Trump tweets about a mouse who ate too much cheese. I don’t think anyone uses it that way any more. They just ask the questions that they would have asked Google back when Google still worked. The machine is too coherent to be really interesting. AI-generated text might be everywhere now, but it’s all just lexical Styrofoam. Back in 2022, <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/a-users-guide-to-the-zairja-of-the">I made a prediction</a>: ‘The more technologically advanced an AI becomes, the less likely it is to produce anything of artistic worth.‘ I think I was right.</p><p>Anyway, AI video is finally getting realistic. Early experiments in video-generation were similarly bizarre and dreamlike. People kept spiralling into the air and transforming, growing rocket engines out their arses, twisting to reveal new and impossible limbs. A pure flow of images collected from the unconscious sediment at the bottom of our visual culture. There was a weird preference for fluids: any AI video was liable to be suddenly interrupted by cascades of water, or muddy gloop, or pools of bubbling liquid, or smoke, or powdery snow, or explosions that burst in slow-motion for no clear reason and with no destructive effect. Protean slop, sloshing around the screen. I like them a lot; I think they might be genuinely useful instruments in the science of dreams. Gaston Bachelard imagined images in dreams being formed out of a psychic substance he compared to dough, clay, or molten metal. The rogue Jungian James Hillman notes that the underworld of dreams is also the bowel, and that the dreamworld is often filled with a diarrhoea-like substance. ‘Diarrhoea signals the daylight order at its end. The old king falls apart and shits like a baby—decomposition and creation at once.’ With AI, we can finally encounter this primordial mindshit in waking life. But not for long. </p><p>At the end of last year, Google unveiled Veo2, its new advanced AI video model. <a href="https://youtu.be/FnWkn3ApZcE">Veo2 is good</a>. If you ask other video models to generate a barman making a cocktail, you’ll get oneiric scenes from beneath the surface of the world: hands sculpting ice cubes out of nothing, liquids spontaneously emerging when an empty glass is stirred with a spoon. Veo2 will show you various liquors being poured into a glass. The level on the bottle even goes down appropriately. In other words, it’s done. There will never be another interesting AI video again. Some people are obsessed with the idea that AI will allow everyone to generate their own high-budget feature-length movies, eliminating the need for an entertainment industry altogether. This will not happen. You could already just sit and <em>imagine</em> the film you’d like to see, moulding it out of psychic goo with the AI video generator inside your head. You could cast whoever you wanted. You could fill it with epic battles and impossible sex scenes. But you don’t do this; you watch a screen like everyone else. At the very most, AI will replace some forms of B-roll. It will be the least consequential technology of your life.</p><h4>A global wave of anti-British hate crimes</h4><p>It’s not easy being British. You have to spend your formative years on a sad, grey, grotty heap of an island, among people who are fundamentally allergic to the idea of happiness—and then, instead of getting the pity you deserve, you have to discover that the entire world hates you. It’s bad enough with our cousins on the European continent. British people have generally positive opinions about the rest of Europe; meanwhile, everyone from the Atlantic to the Urals is united in their disdain for us. Our flabby, lagered-up tourists; our joyless offerings at Eurovision. It’s not really fair, especially when Germany is right there. But then you leave Europe, and it’s even worse. What you soon discover is that absolutely every country in the rest of the world believes themselves to have a deep affinity with the Irish. You all love the Irish, don’t you? They’re so genial and friendly, they’ve got such charismatic accents, and there’s always some honest Irish rogue who participated in your liberation struggle a hundred years ago, because the Irish have always been on the side of the angels. Nobody likes their weird, slimy, awkward neighbours to the east. This country of autistic lizards with shite craic. It is what it is. You learn to accept it.</p><p>What’s harder to accept, though, is when Americans get in on the act. Americans used to like us; they confused our strangled gulping for a sophisticated accent and our profound sexual repression for charm. They’re not really any good at hate, because real hate requires the kind of seething loserish ressentiment that’s hard to summon when you’re the global hegemon. But lately they’ve been getting involved anyway, hating the British, all loud and tactless about it, a small child repeating a joke he doesn’t quite understand. Mostly, they do it by means of ironic quotation marks. <em>British ‘people’ ha ha ha</em>. And I’m glad they’re enjoying themselves, but I draw the line at hearing <em>British ‘food’ ha ha ha</em> from a country that thinks flavour is something you shake out of a plastic tub.</p><p>I know why they do this. Hating the British is racism on easy mode. All the fun of stereotyping—and it is, let’s be honest, pretty fun—with none of the moral iffiness. British people have never been <em>happy</em>, but we’re not the victims of history. Except—as you might have noticed, things are really not going well over here. The whole country is falling apart; the shit’s leaking into the rivers, the prisoners are leaking into your house. Local councils can’t afford to keep the street lights on. We are no longer a rich country—British tech executives make less than the average wage for an Alabama turd-squisher—but we still have some of the most expensive housing in the world. Our last-ditch effort to stop all this was to elect a man called Keir who looks like he’s been carved out of processed ham, but this doesn’t seem to have done anything. The time is rapidly approaching when your great jokes about British ‘people’ might actually start to seem a bit mean-spirited.</p><p>As this island starts to capsize, millions of British people will end up once again arriving on foreign shores. This time, we’ll come to work. English-speaking, impoverished, and ignorant, the British are perfectly placed to become the world’s next low-wage service class. We’ll serve lunches in Lagos, clean floors in Kuala Lumpur, change bedpans in Abu Dhabi, and supply the whores of Singapore. Sometimes the locals might see a miserable-looking British person hard at work, and think: you know, back in Britain he was probably an advertising executive, or a contributor to the <em>New Statesman</em>. You know, his great-grandfather probably used to run this place. But not everyone will have such sympathetic thoughts. Desperate migrants who’ll work for low wages often end up being disliked, and the new wave of British newcomers won’t even be bringing any vibrant ethic cuisine. In 2025, there will be the first in a series of violent pogroms against the British. Ten thousand pissed-up Aussies rampaging through the streets of Melbourne. <em>Poms out! Poms out!</em> Gangs descend on Shanghai’s Anglotown, smashing in the windows of the King’s Head Jolly Ploughman Best Occidental Sausage Pub and spraypainting <em>中国是中国人的</em> on the walls. Or all the British people who make such a big deal about occasionally spending time in New York might find themselves menaced at roadblocks. The questions are weirdly familiar, but the smile’s gone. Say <em>water</em>. Pronounce <em>Worcestershire</em>. Hey, did you ever meet the Queen, you limey fuck? Would you like to? </p><h4>Manbooks: Books for Men</h4><p>In retrospect, the era of the Male Tears mug might have been a mistake. It’s had one lasting legacy, which is that for the first time since everything stopped being published in Latin, men and women occupy entirely separate cultural spheres. I’m not sure this has not been good for either. Why don’t men read fiction any more? the women wonder. Don’t they know that literature makes you a better person? The women are all already two hundred pages into their fortieth book of the year, which is, like the previous thirty-nine, about an elf who gets fucked by a goblin. Meanwhile, the men have been mainlining digital schizojuice straight out the pineal gland of some terrifying bearded paranoiac who thinks all women have scaly vulture-talons they keep sheathed inside their skin. </p><p>This is not a sustainable situation, which is why everyone is now trying to reintegrate men into mainstream culture. The problem is that nobody remembers what we like. It’s been a long time since the heyday of the literary bloke, and there will be a lot of cackhanded attempts. Would you like a book about how it’s ok to be vulnerable? Would you like to be nurtured? How about a novel with camo on the cover, about chill guys who just like hanging out? Maybe you want repeated attempts to turn the figure of the incel into a totemic literary everyman? But in fact, the solution is staring us in the face. Samantha Harvey’s <em>Orbital</em> is the first Booker Prize-winning novel in a long time that people actually want to <em>read</em>. This is partly because while it’s fairly boring, it’s also quite short. But I think the main reason is that despite its lack of any real action, it’s still a novel about a small crew in a tiny craft voyaging around the world. It fills a hole in the literary landscape. We have no end of genre fiction and autofiction and the campus novel and the systems novel and the social novel and the trauma novel and the memoir, but the one classic form that’s still missing is the <em>tale of the sea</em>. Where is the Zoomer Melville? The first person to publish a panoptic 900-page novel set among the polyglot crew of a container ship will single-handedly end this stupid battle of the sexes for a generation. They’ll build statues of you. Get writing.</p><h4>The real Twitter replacement will be an unidentified white powder</h4><p>Shortly after the US general election last year, the Twitter substitute Bluesky saw a surge in new members: something like ten million people signed up in a few weeks. There are a lot of Twitter substitutes knocking around these days. Ever since Elon Musk took over the original and all the advertisers left, the internet has been sprouting text-based social networks like mushrooms on a rotting log. There are Gab and Truth Social, little right-wing phlegm-holes that mysteriously still exist despite the fact that their function is now performed by Twitter itself in its new incarnation as X. There’s Mark Zuckerberg’s Threads app, which Max Read <a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/threads-is-the-gas-leak-social-network">described</a> as ‘the gas-leak social network,’ where ‘everyone on the platform, including you, seems to be suffering some kind of minor brain damage.’ There’s Substack’s unbearable Notes section, which is split between humourless bores who post stock images of old hardbacks captioned ‘writer’s life,’ along with the worst fucking poetry anyone has ever written, and humourless bores who post screeching denunciations of the Jews and their plot against white civilisation, along with more of the worst fucking poetry anyone has ever written. And then there’s Bluesky. </p><p>There are some people I know and like who have decided to join the mass migration there, so I say this with all due caution, but absolutely everyone who has made a Bluesky account is a dangerously irresponsible idiot, and none of them should be trusted to open a bank account by themselves or to operate a car. </p><p>Once, there was Twitter, and it was monstrous and huge, a smokestack-studded weapons factory looming over your town. Then, in 2022, Elon Musk bought the factory and started removing various small but essential screws, and it exploded. All that’s left now is a pool of poisonous sludge called X, where various misshapen creatures with burned skin or melted flesh wallow in the bubbling ooze. Bluesky is like if they built a brand-new pool of poisonous sludge on the other side of town, and invited you to take a swim. For some reason you cretins keep diving in. You’ll escape the hideous, bigoted mutants of the other site, only to start wallowing with a new bunch of hideous mutants that happen to share your politics? <em>Why?</em> When the chemical weapons factory was still standing, you could at least pretend that you <em>had</em> to be there. Twitter was where everything was happening; where you went to promote your stupid webcomic and talk to your annoying community and keep up with the news and the discourse of the day. X isn’t that any more—as far as I can tell, they now have the same discourse of the day every day, and it’s that women have tits and black people commit crime—but Bluesky <em>definitely</em> isn’t. You were free! You had your life back! You could have done anything! Are you really that desperate to spend more of your finite life being hectored by a depressed communist who plays with model trains? </p><p>But I think people are starting to realise this. There are a lot more Bluesky users than there were, but the number of posts, follows, and likes—which is a decent proxy for how much people actually use the site—is steadily <a href="https://bsky.jazco.dev/stats">declining</a>. It’ll be a damp squib, like all these clones are damp squibs. None of them have managed to genuinely replace Twitter, because none of them are honest about what the site’s real function was. All that stuff about Twitter being a <em>digital town square</em> was only a euphemism. Nobody goes online because they genuinely want to look at short-form text content from their favourite brands and creators. They don’t want some washed-up grime MC asking them what they had for breakfast. They absolutely don’t want a safe and inclusive community. What they want is to press their thumbs down hard into someone’s eye sockets and keep pushing until the eyeballs burst like grapes. They want to drink the fluids out of their enemies’ emptied eyes. The appeal of Twitter was that it was a <em>weapons factory</em>. With Twitter, you could reach through the computer and cause genuine, real-life pain to the people you disliked. Get them fired from their job, or cancel the publication of their forthcoming novel, or break up their relationship, or force all their friends to line up and denounce them one by one. It used to happen every day. The accusations weren’t always baseless: sometimes there <em>was no accusation </em>at all; just the <em>form</em> of a Twitter callout was enough to spark a mobbing. If you picked your target right and used the weapon well, you could even kill them. Twitter really was like the Roman Forum, but only on the day they nailed Cicero’s severed head and hands to the rostrum. </p><p>You can’t kill anyone on Bluesky. If you want, you can be really weird about Jesse Singal on there, and he might whine about it afterwards, as if it matters, but it doesn’t. You can’t touch him. That game is over.</p><p>Still, there are two ways I can see something like it coming back. The first is if anyone is brave enough to invent a social media platform where every user has to wire themselves up to an electrode, which delivers a painful shock whenever enough other users turn against them. I think people would flock to any platform that offers the chance to give Stephen Fry a heart attack, especially if it meant the risk of being electrocuted themselves, but it’s probably not going to happen. That leaves the other big potential Twitter replacement. This is a platform that already exists, and already contains all your least favourite celebrities, pundits, and influencers. You do sort of have to be there, and it really is where the conversation’s happening. It’s free to use, it never goes down, and—crucially—it can be used to commit acts of extreme violence. It’s called ‘extended reality.’ As all the other Twitter methadones stop working, expect an upswing in bizarre and unaccountable acts of public violence and private revenge. In 2025, you will see hate figures receiving small pouches of unidentified white powder in the mail. You will see wine poisoned at the book launch. Eighty literary it girls puking up endless red fluid outside the LRB Bookshop until they collapse shivering in the slime. Once, frustrated magazine interns could climb the ladder by spreading a bunch of wild accusations on Twitter; now, they’ll have no option except to let off a deadly nerve agent inside the office. A beloved sportswriter will be forced to eat a hand grenade before exploding in a shower of soft red flakes. You really can get a lot more done when you put down your phone and start living in the real world. </p>

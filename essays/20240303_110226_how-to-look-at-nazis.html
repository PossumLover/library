Late last year, a few of this platform’s users started loudly complaining about the existence on Substack of a small but active ecosystem of actual, outright neo-Nazis. People who post pictures of swastikas and give updates on the nefarious activities of the Jew. The decent folks wanted something done about this: for the site’s management to clarify that <em>you are not allowed to be a Nazi</em>. The management refused, which seemed to upset a lot of people. Weeks of public anger. Open letters. Duelling takes. Ultimatums. A few high-profile names announced that they would be leaving the platform, and taking their newsletters—which all seemed to consist of collections of other people’s tweets—with them. For a while, the line was that everyone still using Substack was, whether consciously or not, aligning themselves with the forces of fascism. And then, eventually, without anything really happening, it all died down. These things always die down in the end.</p><p>As you might have noticed, I’m still here. This is not because I have any particular fondness for Nazis. Shortly after the whole slapfight broke out, though, Substack’s recommendation algorithm kept insisting that I’d want to read one particular post about it, which consisted of a bunch of swastikas, photos of Adolf Hitler, and links to Amazon searches for history books about the Third Reich. In between all of these, the author would write something along the lines of ‘What’s that, woke commies? You don’t like this picture of Reinhard Heydrich, the Butcher of Prague? Does it offend you? Does it hurt your wickle feelings? Do you want to <em>cry</em>? Well guess what, losers, <em>I don’t care</em>!’ The piece appears to have been very popular. I must have read it a dozen times, experiencing a feeling of deep discontent that I couldn’t quite identify. Eventually, I realised that I was, in fact, <em>offended</em>. Not by the swastikas and the photos of Hitler, but by the author’s smugly cretinous insistence that I <em>would</em> be horribly offended by them. This person was so dim that he thought the anti-Nazi brigade would recoil, like a vampire from garlic, at a standard academic history of twentieth-century Germany. His attempt to offend was so cackhanded that it actually ended up being very effective.</p><p>So: I’m offended. Does that mean I want this person to be <em>censored</em>? Well, actually, <em>yes</em>! Intellectually, I don’t agree with the censorship campaigners. I have a general aversion to busybodies of all stripes, and I think there’s something unpleasant about the urge to scrub everything that displeases you off the face of the planet. Overcoming that urge is, I think, a crucial part of <em>growing up</em>. But when you’re genuinely offended, none of that matters. I felt the urge very keenly. Whatever my opinions on free speech, in the surging spring of my being I wanted this dogshit gone. I wanted its author to be forbidden from spreading his tedious crap in public. If necessary, they should break his fingers.</p><p>I think the real difference between me and the anti-Nazi campaigners is that I wouldn’t stop there. They want to censor people because of their political opinions, but why limit ourselves? Consider that this platform is absolutely <em>riddled</em> with a type of person I’ve been calling the Feeble-Minded Business Maniac, or FMBM. The FMBM composes lists of books with titles like <em>Slurp: The Science of How Hotter Soup Leads to Smarter Insights</em> or <em>Cow Goes Moo: Eight Basic Barnyard Lessons for Life and Work</em>. The FMBM issues terrible stock tips or hawks crypto: the Nazis might <em>want</em> to hurt people, but the FMBM is actively harming his readers every single day. Isn’t there a good case for getting rid of them all? Or there’s the Frothing Political Dullard, or FPD, who is equally endemic to this site. The FPD spends every waking moment in a state of total panic over vaccines, or trans people—or Nazis. She posts what is essentially the same giddy screed about her chosen issue every day, sometimes multiple times a day. Reading an FPD is deadly. You start out with some vague unease about the subject, and end up pickling your brain in her obsessive fixation until all its other functions wither and you’re literally incapable of talking about anything else. Some FPDs are also Nazis, but because Nazism is inherently offputting, the most dangerous ones are not. In fact, the most dangerous ones usually have incredibly normal, mainstream, obvious opinions, just at a psychotic pitch. They produce literally nothing of value, and they are a threat to the sanity of all our parents. There is absolutely no reason why any of them should be allowed to write.</p><p>But because I am ruthlessly honest with myself, eventually I have to admit that my objection to all this stuff isn’t really as principled as I want it to be. When I write for you here, I’m usually trying to produce something weird and interesting and good. Making nice sentences is the only job I have, and I care about my craft. The presence of all those swastikas on Substack is intolerable because it reminds me that actually, I’m not really doing anything qualitatively <em>different</em> to the people I hate. We’re all inputting text strings into the same box. Just like everyone else, I’m desperately trying to turn those text strings into money, and money makes<em> </em>everything formally equivalent. All words are just code for dollar values. As far as the machine is concerned, my sincere attempts at producing something worthwhile in prose and your third rant of the week against the woke left are utterly interchangeable. </p><p>In other words, what I ultimately despise in the other is his resemblance to myself. And I think maybe the ability to recognise this about your own hatred is what distinguishes the good, upstanding bitter shrivelled toad from the potential Nazi. </p><p>Anyway, I’ve been learning a lot from the Nazis lately. The upshot of this whole brief episode is that Substack’s algorithm noticed me reading a post full of swastikas over and over again, and it’s now absolutely certain that what I must really want is loads and loads more writing from the outer reaches of the American right. Maybe I deserve this. In 2020, as many of my comrades decided to abandon thought and critique for various forms of slogan-chanting, I started noticing something new on the other side. The right used to be profoundly anti-intellectual, but now the left had taken its own anti-intellectual turn, and there seemed to be a few people on the right willing to <em>think</em>: to read old books and generate new ideas and consider principles other than the senseless churning of the market. People who were interested in the world and its workings. I didn’t think much of their politics, but I was hopeful that there might at least be something here worth disagreeing with. And I do think there are a few people on the new right worth disagreeing with—but only a few. The vast majority of them are on the same intellectual level as the swastika guy. People incapable of writing the word ‘beauty’ without a capital B. People who think that referring to the people they disagree with as ‘the regime’ constitutes a political analysis. This isn’t a movement, it’s a dress-up game. Greasy young men who live in a drywall suburb in Arizona and write sentences like ‘nay, take heart, gentle reader, for as long as but one of our number breathes, that hallowed Tradition is not perished yet.’ If you start freaking out about how dangerous and scary these Nazis are, all you’re really doing is playing dress-up with them. One of them begins every missive with the words ‘Salutations, Aryan Man!’ These people are not serious. What they are is tremendously, tremendously thick. </p><p>And lately, they’ve all been very thick about <em>Starship Troopers</em>.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Paul Verhoeven’s <em>Starship Troopers</em> is notionally an adaptation of some unimportant book by Robert Heinlein. In fact, it’s an adaptation of the evening in 1944, recorded in <em>Minima Moralia</em>, when Theodor Adorno visited a cinema in Los Angeles to see the progress of the war. ‘Cinema newsreel: the invasion of the Marianas, including Guam. The impression is not of battles, but of civil engineering and blasting operations undertaken with immeasurably intensified vehemence, also of fumigation, insect-extermination on a terrestrial scale. Works are put on hand until no grass grows. The enemy acts as patient and corpse. Like the Jews under Fascism, he features now as merely the object of technical and administrative measures.’ In the middle of the heroic struggle against fascism, Adorno saw, bubbling up through the image on the screen, the lure and the blankness of fascism. </p><p><em>Starship Troopers</em> presents itself as a science fiction film about a war between an authoritarian global government called the Federation and a race of ravenous giant space insects. Our hero is a beautiful all-American jock with a beautiful all-American girlfriend who finally lets him sleep with her after their high school prom. He lives in a world of wealth, pleasure and entertainment, but he gives it all up, and disobeys his parents in the process, to join the Mobile Infantry. ‘Service guarantees citizenship.’ Suddenly he’s cast into war. His home city is wiped out by a bug meteor. His friends are torn to shreds between bug mandibles. In the end, he strikes a devastating victory for human civilisation in its galactic struggle against the insects. But he does so while wearing a <em>Nazi uniform</em>. All these people, these beautiful friends and lovers, with their yearnings, their cheerful good humour, their tragedy, their tears—all of them are wearing Nazi uniforms. Maybe you could avoid noticing this for a while. A lot of armies have grey jackets. A lot of countries have eagles in their insignia. But towards the end, our hero’s old school buddy shows up <em>dressed like an SS officer</em>. It is not subtle. If you have ever consumed any entertainment media about the Second World War, you know exactly what this costume means. It looks like this:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

Thousands of reposts; dozens of Substack losers lining up to agree. But what’s particularly notable about this critique is that here, the online intellectuals of the new right are <em>exactly the same</em> as the blue-haired YA-reading tenderqueers they claim to despise. They are both bizarrely incapable of considering a work of art <em>as a work of art</em>, on the level of totality. It’s all about which characters you identify with, or who are the goodies and who are the baddies. Fragments standing in for the whole. There’s an entire generation of basically psychotic readers who assume that if a character in a novel says or does something racist or problematic, the book itself is racist and problematic. Representation equals endorsement. And this person thinks in exactly the same way. He talks about the Federation <em>as if it’s real</em>. He’s trying to judge it as an actually existing political order. So he notes that the streets are clean and the schools are efficient. For some reason, Verhoeven is trying to mock this wonderful society, while this genius here bravely stand up in its defence. But it doesn’t exist! It’s a dictatorship in the far future with uniforms from 1940s Germany! Where all the young people are gorgeous, and sacrifice their gorgeous bodies for the social whole! This is not a possible society. It’s a filmic image. A <em>fantasy</em>.</p><p>At the risk of stating the extremely obvious: what <em>Starship Troopers</em> is showing you is a fascist society’s <em>fantasy about itself</em>. The film is set inside a Nazi’s head. This is why the Federation’s enemies in the film are mute, mindless, hideous insects. The point is not that the bugs are somehow <em>good</em>. They’re not! They’re giant man-eating arachnids with horrible claws, and what’s more, they also don’t exist! The point is that <em>this is how fascism represents its enemies</em>: as insects, an infestation, to be exterminated on a planetary scale. And Verhoeven did not make his characters clean and well-groomed by <em>accident</em>; he deliberately chose actors who look like they might have stepped out of <em>The Triumph of the Will</em>, because these are the faces with which fascism represents itself. You are not being clever when you point out that the Nazis are all so handsome. You are not being insightful when you point out that the streets are clean. </p><p>To be fair, though, it’s not as if the critics on the left have done much better. For some reason, they keep presenting the film as a kind of <em>test</em>: one that they, as the very nicest and cleverest boys and girls, have been smart enough to pass. If you’re a good person, you notice that this film is a critique of fascism, and all the heroes are actually evil. If you’re a bad person, you’ll get too invested in the dumb action sequences to realise that war is bad. And once you fail the test, you deserve whatever you get. </p><p>But this film is not a critique of fascism; it’s a critique of <em>you</em>. You’re <em>supposed</em> to identify with these chiselled heroes in their war against the insects. You’re <em>supposed</em> to be seduced. Don’t lie: you had your sexual awakening to that coed shower scene, just like I did. You felt the thrill of desire for this beautiful, sexless world. Where it’s normal for men and women to shower together, because all libido has been requisitioned for the higher interests of the state. That whole scene is terrifyingly attuned to the grubby little fantasies of a thirteen-year-old boy. You’re desperate to have some kind of interaction with a naked woman, so desperate you’re practically tearing off your own skin. But the prospect of an actual sexual encounter, of taking responsibility for your own desire, is terrifying. The Federation has the answer. It will fulfil your desire at the small cost of annihilating it, and you would have happily given up all your political rights if it meant being surrounded by all those soapy asexual tits. Just like any other Holywood spectacle, <em>Starship Troopers</em> presents you with alluring images. There’s some weird black hole of desire lurking in the background, but for the most part you’re supposed to respond to those images in exactly the normal way. Until, eventually, you come to the queasy realisation that what you’ve been doing this entire time is <em>supporting the Nazis</em>. </p><p>The point is that you are not as good as you think. It’s easy for you to believe, now, that you would never have been a Nazi. You think you would have stood up, done something, hidden Jews in your house, fought with the Resistance; obviously <em>you</em> would never fall for the propaganda. But maybe you would. Unfortunately, nobody wants to actually receive this message. The bright minds of the new right are genuinely incapable of even <em>comprehending</em> it. They don’t experience any sense of nausea when they realise they’ve been supporting the Nazis, because they’ve internet-poisoned themselves into supporting the Nazis anyway. They even write Twitter threads about it: <em>if these Nazis are so bad, then how come I agree with them? </em>They are outside the intended audience. Which is fine; these people don’t really matter. But the left can’t seem to get it either. We’re all too neurotically fixated on being <em>good</em>, being clean, having a high level of media literacy, and never, not even once, feeling sympathy for the wrong kind of person. <em>Other people</em> might have fallen for it, but <em>we</em> were on the right side all along. So we never confront the part of ourselves that’s actually capable of complicity with evil. We refuse to see our own reflection in the despised other’s face.</p><p>In other words, <em>Starship Troopers</em> really does fail. You can imagine a slightly more sophisticated critique of the project than the one above: why does Verhoeven try to play all these Brechtian games with his audience? Leading them along, tugging at their desires, and then distancing, blasting them with the nightmares of the twentieth century? ‘A representation that alienates is one which allows us to recognise its subject, but at the same time makes it seem unfamiliar.’ Trying to mechanically induce anagnorisis. It doesn’t work! People refuse to gain any new understandings through art; they just think the same things they always thought, in new and dumber ways. Why not just <em>make movies</em>? Try creating an aesthetic object, instead of this deeply programmatic instrument for messing around with other people’s minds. What’s wrong with ordinary visual pleasure?</p><p>What’s wrong, I think, is that it’s not always so easy to disentangle ordinary visual pleasure from fascism. From a certain view, fascism <em>is</em> the cinema: cinema as a total organising mode of social life. Here is the leader: he <em>represents</em> you, and you are to <em>identify</em> with him. Linger, lovingly, over his face; his image. Walter Benjamin called fascism the aestheticisation of politics, ‘the introduction of aesthetics into political life.’ Suddenly the image is where everything takes place. Politics becomes a parade, silver jangling on perfect uniforms; a show. What’s the point of a mass rally in a non-agonistic society, where everything is supposed to work in perfect harmony? What are we rallying for? Wrong sort of question: it looks nice, that’s all. It’s a show: it’s for the audience, for <em>you</em>. The world can be beautiful. But ‘all efforts to render politics aesthetic culminate in one thing: war.’ Soon we’ll discover that death is beautiful too. Susan Sontag noted that ‘painters and sculptors under the Nazis often depicted the nude, but they were forbidden to show any bodily imperfections. Their nudes look like pictures in physique magazines: pinups which are both sanctimoniously asexual and (in a technical sense) pornographic, for they have the perfection of a fantasy.’ Maybe you could call them <em>lifeless</em>. Fascism is when living flesh takes on the dead glow of the image, dying into a symbol before dying again into a corpse. Again in <em>Minima Moralia</em>, Adorno calls fascism the ‘absolute sensation.’ He notes that ‘in the course of the war, even news of calamity was finally given full publicity in Germany, and the slow military collapse was not hushed up.’ In the end, fascism even managed to stage its own destruction as a kind of entertainment. </p><p>This is why filmmakers, honest ones at least, get nervous around fascism: what they do is <em>not that different</em> from what the dictator does. Turning images into meanings and meanings into images; conjuring unities. There’s something dangerous about the <em>visual</em>, the power of sight. Domination is always implied. Usually, the seeing eye that roves the world is sovereign over what it surveys; in Renaissance art, God is a disembodied eye, floating by itself in the corner of the scene. But park thousands of eyes in front of some spectacular image, and all that power vanishes. Now the eye is just an intermediary, hooked up to your camera. Great masses of people look at the world exclusively through your little mechanical hole. </p><p>Maybe it’s not so surprising that the grouchier postwar critics kept insisting that pop culture was essentially totalitarian. The really great pop artists have tended to agree. David Bowie naming Hitler as the first rock star. Andy Warhol with his portraits of Mao. You can try it yourself: watch <em>The Triumph of the Will</em>, and then immediately afterwards watch the Beatles on <em>The Ed Sullivan Show</em>. Sorry, but it is, it’s exactly the same thing. The massed ranks of the audience. Faces convulsing in delight. You can barely hear the band over their screaming. This cult that’s come to turn your children insane. The only difference is that Hitler had to say it outright: all aspects of German life must be subordinated to the will of the Party; the destiny of the Reich is now the most important thing in your life, the only thing you care about. The Beatles just say they want to hold your hand, because those hyperventilating teens don’t need to be told. They already believe it. They’re already desperate to subordinate their lives to the eternal and indestructible pillar of John and Paul.</p><p>What everyone takes away from <em>The Triumph of the Will</em> are the crowd scenes. All those people in their identical uniforms, depersonalised by sheer number, becoming something like architecture, or geometry. A sterile, deathly beauty. This is the visual language that Verhoeven borrows in <em>Starship Troopers</em>, the one that reeks of fascism. And Riefenstahl did get to play around with her human toys at will. Ostensibly, <em>Triumph of the Will</em> is a documentary about the 1934 Nuremberg Rally; in fact, the rally was the set for her film. She got to rearrange the columns of stormtroopers to get the perfect shot, or lay tracks for her dolly across the Zeppelin Field. But she didn’t get to design the set. All those monumental masses were Albert Speer’s; her only job was to film them. Riefenstahl’s actual cinematic idiom comes out in the close shots of <em>human faces</em>. And unlike most of the official artists of the Third Reich, she had an actual artist’s eye. She lingers on the imperfections. Punctums; things that stick out at odd angles; flashes of individual humanity. There’s a soldier staring off at slightly the wrong angle. Bored children rubbing their eyes as the death squads march past. Farm girls, here to give Hitler some symbolic vegetables, but shaking his hand with just a little too much vigour. Or the young man who <em>turns away</em> when Hitler leans in for a chat.</p><p>Maybe this could be fodder for Riefenstahl’s rehabilitation. Even when she was making propaganda for the Nazis, she still found a way to slip in some small fragments of the human spirit. Tiny moments of subversion. But I don’t buy it. Everything in <em>The Triumph of the Will</em> was meticulously staged, and these small spontaneous moments are no exception. The more unsettling possibility is that these flashes of individuality are not as foreign to fascism as we might hope. Maybe it’s significant that the most quirky and distinct figure in the film is none other than Adolf Hitler.</p><p>It’s weird, watching Hitler without his usual penumbra of evil. In the opening sequences, Riefenstahl’s camera sticks very close to Hitler’s face as the motorcade takes him into Nuremberg. You experience events through Hitler’s eyes. This is the fantasy: you’re not one of the nameless masses surrendering your individuality for the Reich; you’re supposed to imagine <em>being Hitler</em>. Living in Hitler’s body, wearing Hitler’s face, having people salute you wherever you go… On stage, Hitler rants about destiny and eternity and the fittest of the race, which is all just death, death, death. But listen to the <em>way</em> he speaks. Unlike the other Nazis, he rolls his ‘r’s. He’s trying to sound proper. It’s such a hilariously petit-bourgeois affectation, the sort of thing you’d expect from someone who lives in a house full of chintz and always calls a napkin a serviette, not the great annihilator of nations. Whenever he’s <em>not</em> speaking, Hitler comes across as a cheerful, silly, goofy little guy. Look at that big honking grin on his face. Look at that slightly fey wrist gesture of his. The only person in the country who <em>doesn’t</em> do a Hitler salute. See how pleased he is to be presented with such a very big basket of corn. I realised I’d never actually considered his face as anything other than a symbol. Adolf Hitler has very thin lips, but this sort of puffy zone between his bottom lip and his chin. He has permanently worried eyes. In the end, it’s such a <em>normal</em> face, this face that destroyed half of Europe. Without his moustache, he could be a nervous little bank manager from Swindon. In a way, that’s exactly what he was. </p><p>Cinema is not rescued by the small, the intimate, or the personal. All your tenderest images are actually pictures of Hitler. </p><p>Filmmakers have found ways around this. Hans-Jürgen Syberberg starts with the understanding that Hitler is a director and the director is Hitler. ‘No disaster film, but disaster as film.’ But he still believes cinema has something to do. ‘How suspicious are those who ask: Why do we do this here? Talking, acting, showing, bleeding at the end of our inheritance. Question: Why make a film about that? But what else?’ <em>Hitler: a Film from Germany</em> is a mad, meditative, galaxy-spanning attempt to <em>work through</em> the Hitler-image. Exhaust it by repetition. Hitler is a photo, an actor, a puppet, the Devil. Maybe most of all, he is yourself. Sontag called <em>Hitler</em> an ‘allegory-littered wasteland’ and ‘endless intellectual melody’ but even she couldn’t adequately describe it.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> The film is eight hours long and playing at the Lincoln Center this month; you know what to do. But in the same decade, Pasolini’s <em>Salò</em> does the opposite: he refines the alluring image, boils it down until you can see what it’s really made of. Here are your beautiful naked youths, here’s your gorgeous Italian palace. Nice piano music. But there’s nothing alluring here. Pasolini never lets you forget that when you consume these rich and wonderful images of your unfreedom, what you are actually doing is <em>eating shit</em>, eating a human turd off the floor, eating a banquet of turds out of a silver tureen. The film might be explicit, but it has absolutely nothing to do with porn. At the end, as the last beautiful youths are being tortured to death, the pianist suddenly stops playing, opens a window, and smashes herself against the rocks below. The final acts of tongue-cutting and scalping and murder are unaccompanied. Our libertines watch through binoculars. That’s you. An honest artist would die before giving you what you want.</p><p>That was the 1970s. The latest crop of films about fascism are very different. A kind of asceticism: they abstain from the image altogether. <em>Occupied City</em> is about the Nazi occupation of Amsterdam. The film moves methodically through the city, street by street, house by house, as our narrator describes what happened here in a calm, slightly sugary voice. Who was tortured, who was deported, who was shot. This house was used by the resistance. This house was used by the police. In one house after another, entire Jewish families gassed themselves rather than let the Germans do it. But you never see the Nazis. Everything you see was filmed from 2020 to 2022. Children sledding, old men playing bowls and arguing in Arabic, trams, bikes, where the Nazis used to march. A school full of giggling teenagers that used to be a Nazi prison. Sometimes you see inside the living room of a home where something terrible happened. Nice sofas, big TV. It could be anyone’s home now, even yours. </p><p>It’s a gimmick, but <em>Occupied City</em> does <em>work</em>. You feel it, just how thinly painted the present is over the past. That all these things really happened, really <em>here</em>. But the most effective piece of apophatic cinema is obviously <em>The Zone of Interest</em>. After I watched it, someone asked me if I’d enjoyed the film. This felt like the wrong question. No, I did not enjoy <em>The Zone of Interest</em>. It was <em>horrible</em>, probably the most unpleasant cinematic experience of my life. <em>Salò</em> doesn’t even come close. I spent one hundred minutes in a state of total panic. Sitting in my seat with my heart pounding and the blood antic in my ears. So full of fear and nausea that it was hard to even focus on the film. When we find the jawbone in the river I had to rewind three times and watch it again, and every time I still couldn’t see the actual bone past the pullulation of my anxiety.</p><p>Almost nothing happens in <em>The Zone of Interest</em>. Rudolf Höss and his family live in a house. Servants prepare dinner and gossip with each other. His wife plants the gardens. He reads to his kids. His mother-in-law comes to stay; eventually she leaves. He gets a new job, which means moving away, but then he gets to come back. It’s all very well-mannered. Pleasant, calmly composed. This film is notionally based on the Martin Amis novel of the same name, but it features literally none of the plot, just the setting. Rudolf Höss is the commandant at Auschwitz, and his house backs on to the walls of the camp. You never once see inside the camp. But you can hear it. Glazer describes the soundtrack as ‘the other film, and, arguably, <em>the</em> film.’ The ambient drone of furnaces and machinery, clunking, throbbing, like a toothache, like a nightmare constantly playing in the back of your head. How can anyone live with all this noise? Trains pull in with their cargo. Human voices shout, too distant to make out the words. Dogs bark into the night. Sometimes gunshots. Crying. Screams. The industrial symphony of one million dead. Everyone pretends not to notice, and for a while it feels like going mad: maybe they can’t even hear it, maybe it’s just you. But they can hear it. There are moments where it comes out. The little boy in his room, playing peacefully with a handful of human teeth. The wife snapping at her maid when she puts out too many breakfast sausages. ‘I could have my husband spread your ashes across the fields.’</p><p>In a way, <em>The Zone of Interest</em> and <em>Starship Troopers</em> are two versions of the same film. All they actually <em>show</em> you is the sunshine of fascism. Its scotomised idyll. In both films, you are one of the Nazis: looking at the flowers in the garden while dying men scream. (Glazer’s film was first shown before the current campaign of mass murder in Gaza, but the echoes are obvious. In one way or another, this is what you’ve been doing your entire life.) But weirdly, I’ve yet to see the hermeneutic prodigies of the new right try to extend their analysis of <em>Starship Troopers</em> to <em>The Zone of Interest</em>. What’s the matter, guys? Don’t you believe in Beauty as a political ideal? Don’t you think aesthetics and ethics are basically the same thing? Isn’t this what you’re all about, total warfare for the sake of precisely this kind of insipid niceness, cottages with peaked roofs, paintings of bunnies and daffodils? Aren’t you going to praise Frau Höss for her lovely flowerbeds? Doesn’t the commandant have beautiful blond children? Isn’t Auschwitz <em>clean</em>?</p><p>The difference is that in <em>Starship Troopers</em> the façade never cracks. There’s never a moment where Verhoeven lets you peek through the curtains to reassure you that yes, a world exists outside the deranged Nazi fantasy. But Glazer does. Sequences shot through a thermal camera in which a Polish girl hides food for the starving prisoners. A kind of fairy-tale air: not that this couldn’t have happened—it did happen, and the actress is wearing the real girl’s actual dress—but it’s full of Grimmlike ciphers, a girl with braided hair, walking alone in the forest, a hidden apple, until at the end the thermal camera picks up the soft rain of human ashes blowing through the night. And then there’s the ending. Höss walks down an empty staircase in Berlin. At every floor he stops, gags, retches, spits. He stares into the darkness of a long corridor. And suddenly we’re in Auschwitz, finally on the other side of the wall, but in the present day. The camp Höss built is now a museum to his victims. We watch staff sweep and vacuum the floors, polish the exhibits. The same trick from <em>Occupied City</em>—but McQueen never pointed his camera at the Anne Frank House, where the Holocaust becomes a tourist attraction. It’s really not clear what this sequence means. There have been a lot of articles SEOd for the phrase ‘zone of interest ending explained,’ but all of them have drastically different explanations. Höss is being haunted by the future, his own moral wretchedness. Or he’s having a vision of his insignificance: the Jews survive, the victims are commemorated, and he is not. Or maybe it’s the opposite: he’s satisfied to see that his work has, in a way, outlived the Third Reich. Or maybe the point is that Auschwitz <em>hasn’t changed</em>, and people are still doing mundane tasks in the shadow of the crematoria. </p><p>For what it’s worth, I’m not really convinced by any of these. The really important thing about the museum sequence is that it <em>ends</em>. We return to Rudolf Höss, staring down a hallway, just past the camera. His fit of retching is over, and so is whatever vision we just shared. He heads downstairs, calmly, efficiently, back to Auschwitz and his work. For a moment, we saw the place behind the wall, but only once it had become a representation of itself. We were in the realm of the image, where your job is to interpret things after the fact, work out what it all <em>means</em>. But that was an illusion. We are not after the fact. The year is not 2024. It’s still happening. The year is 1943.</p><p>A lot of people didn’t like <em>The Zone of Interest</em>. Read the one-star reviews on Google; there are plenty of them. This film is <em>boring</em>. It doesn’t give you any insight into the psychology or motivations of its characters. Nobody is even remotely likeable. You keep waiting for one of the Höss family to have the big moral epiphany that <em>the Holocaust is bad</em>, and none of them ever do. ‘I do not understand why does the director wants us to relate ourselves to Nazis, making them just the same as we are. This message does not inspire people to make a change.’ It’s not even remotely life-affirming. Why isn’t it life-affirming? A lot of people compared it unfavourably to <em>The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</em>, which is also about the family of a concentration camp commandant, and happens to be possibly the most grossly offensive piece of shit ever screened. Unlike <em>The Zone of Interest</em>, it’s got a plot, and characters you can identify with, and a little boy who transcends the forces of hate through the power of childlike innocence and also friendship. A heartwarming, cathartic, visually splendid film all about the Final Solution. This time, the commandant’s wife is <em>horrified</em> when she finds out what’s happening in the camp. At the end even the commandant is weeping in the rain. Most of the films I’ve talked about here try to show you how you too might be complicit in evil, but this one doesn’t. You’re not a Nazi! You’re a good person! Your only surrogate is the angelic German child who makes friends with the little Jewish boy across the barbed wire. But if you’re not prepared to open up the ugly places inside us all, evil becomes entirely inexplicable: you end up thinking that even the Nazis can’t have been <em>that</em> bad. <em>The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</em> is what all the other filmmakers were trying to avoid: a piece of pure visual entertainment that ends up being an apologia for fascism. </p><p>But while <em>The Zone of Interest</em> avoids that danger, it’s not really in any sense a <em>film</em>. Paul Schrader called it a ‘great-ish movie’ but also, ultimately, ‘more like a parlour trick than an exploration.’ He’s not wrong. I can’t help but feel like there’s something <em>prudish</em> about the film’s austere refusal to actually represent its object in images. Yes, when you start playing around with beautiful illusions, there’s the risk of being complicit in what you represent. But if your point is that <em>all of us</em> have the potential for evil, then why are you so desperate to keep <em>your</em> hands clean? In the end, I think the current crop of cold, clinical, devastatingly <em>precise</em> films about fascism might have less to teach us than the lurid, even tasteless wallowing in images of Syberberg or Verhoeven.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> I began this piece with someone who seemed to think that Nazism and a picture of a Nazi are one and the same thing.

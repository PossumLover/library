So I was hanging out with some of my beautiful and talented friends the other day and we ended up talking about how none of us are writing personal essays any more. If you don’t remember the personal essay, there were like ~10 years in which the only way to get nonfiction published online was to talk about the worst day you’d ever had in your life, and I guess we kept on having worse and worse days all the time to make a living, which seemed viable at the time. But now all the online publications that used to publish personal essays have gone bust, and we’re left out here in the sunshine no longer sure what to do.</p><p>Or maybe it has something to do with the pandemic, because for a while instead of having experiences we were all just having lots of little thoughts. Which is much better! Personally I love it, thinking about things. I’ve been thinking about the relation between writing and responsibility. I’ve not been thinking anything in particular <em>about</em> it, I’ve just been thinking. I’ve been thinking about the lustrousness of saying <em>I</em> in literary nonfiction. I’ve been thinking about what makes the weird guys weird. It’s so lovely to be able to think, like floating down a gentle river on your back on a golden summer afternoon, without your thinking ever being dragged down by anything as dull and heavy as an argument or an interpretation.</p><p>I read the recent book everyone’s been talking about, and it made me think about the recent film everyone’s been talking about, and how much I loved both of them but also hated them. I’ve been thinking about how it feels to deeply love something but also hate everything specific about it, which happens to be exactly how I feel about all my beautiful and talented friends. And this got me thinking about <em>Tár</em>, which I’m still somehow thinking about midway through 2023. I’ve been thinking about the taste of blackcurrants and the complications of online dating. I’ve been thinking about Margery Kempe and the houseplants I love but not enough to keep them alive. I’ve been thinking about beheadings and sunbeams. I’ve been having lots of thoughts. Lots and lots of lovely little thoughts. </p><h4>How to write mainstream literary fiction</h4><p>Get an MFA. </p><p>Contemporary literary fiction is a very particular <em>technique</em>, and you can learn how to do it at any MFA programme. They will teach you how to produce prose that is neutral and plain and very readable, studded with half-sentences of nice description that make the reader do a little <em>ah</em> half-smile, but without ever being too florid. They will teach you how to make your characters more relatable. They will teach you how to sprinkle in just enough sensory detail that everything feels vividly real. You will learn to come up with exactly one clever, contrived turn of phrase every two pages, so the reader will notice that you’re a good writer without getting trapped in any brambly texture of words. To write material that is never tough or chewy or difficult, and always pleasurable to read. Words that slip down like a nice jelly, like chewing butter. </p><p>This sounds like I’m being dismissive. I’m not. It takes a lot of craft to get this right. Most contemporary literary fiction is like the Academic <em>art pompier</em> of the nineteenth century: there’s serious skill in there, endless hours studying the human figure and the way light moves across its surfaces until you can produce a version that’s perfect and smooth and clean, in the same way that the heroes of contemporary literary fiction can perfectly describe every slight emotive ripple as it passes across the surface of their smooth clean fucked-up psyches. There are no brushstrokes, and painting without brushstrokes takes skill too.</p><p>After your MFA you will publish a book. Every year, exactly one person who’s done an MFA sells an unseemly number of books and becomes incredibly rich and famous. There is absolutely no way of predicting who this will be, which is why all the other books still get published. For everyone else, there’s the consolation prize, which is that you will get to teach writing in an MFA programme. (Ever noticed that all the most violently unhinged people you know keep training to become therapists?) But there’s always a chance. It might be you. </p><h4>How to write the kind of fiction that gets published by an ‘interesting’ small press</h4><p>⠀</p><p>⠀</p><p>use lots of white space</p><p>&amp; obsolete internet abbreviations like <em>yr</em> instead of <em>your</em>  </p><p>⠀⠀⠀⠀ because u r a piece of technology too tight coiled wires pulsing information just beneath yr hot &amp; hungry skin</p><p>⠀</p><p>⠀</p><p>&amp; speak about god &amp; yearning &amp; festering flesh &amp; the horns of the distant moon </p><p>⠀⠀⠀⠀&amp; nostalgia for myspace or w/e</p><p>⠀</p><p>&amp; read poetry off yr phone from yr collection entitled <em>i have a terrarium in my brain</em> wearing a long plastic trenchcoat &amp; a bobble hat pulled up to the very top of yr head &amp; never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever look directly at the audience</p><p>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ which is small but there is one it's there</p><p>⠀</p><p>⠀</p><h4>How to write the radical, urgent fiction of online</h4><p>God, when did art get taken over by all these fucking <em>losers</em>? Prissy little regime freaks mewling about their fake and gay <em>feelings</em>. You are not like them. You have nothing in common with the nice women who had happy childhoods and work at publishing houses. You are a creature of pure energy and will. Your biggest literary influences are Yukio Mishima, Antonin Artaud, and a guy called The Hamitic Theory Rapist who sends unhinged death threats to random black people (which you can only fully appreciate for the works of comic genius they are if you come to them having read Mishima and Artaud). You live in a kind of nest you made for yourself in the woods, built out of old issues of <em>Hustler</em> glued together with spit, and you will sit in there cackling as you watch the cities burn.</p><p>You are going to do things differently. You are going to write without contractions, which are unworthy of a serious writer and, you aver, symptomatic of the degeneration of Art and Beauty into lifeless demotic goo. In every thoughtlessly truncated word lies the same decrepitude by which as grand an appellation as ‘The Men’s Room’ no longer signifies some solemn book-lined chamber within which men of quality may discuss the great issues of their day, but has come to denote a mere hole for pissing in. It is incumbent upon you to arrest this aforesaid degeneracy by means of your impeccable literary vitalism, to wit, a story about the kind of person you don’t like, who masturbates to sissy porn and then kills himself. A mere few strokes of your pen, and your muscular masculine prose—<em>real</em> writing, sufficient to express the contours of <em>real</em> existence, laced with <em>real</em> memes—will instantaneously obliterate the sterile neologisms and fussy indecipherable ingroup-speak of the skinnyfat zogslop longhouse NPC bugman globohomo egregore.

Keep pushing until you break through the cribriform plate and slide the chopstick directly into your brain. Wiggle it vigorously around. </p><h4>How to write something that might not be bad</h4><p>To work out how to write well, you first have to know why people write badly. And what I’m getting at with all of this is that all bad writing is a failure of <em>style</em>. Not in the sense that bad writers haven’t developed enough of a style: the problem is usually that they do it too well. </p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Writers like writing rules for other writers. Some of these are famous. George Orwell: ‘Never use a long word where a short one will do.’ Some are fatuous. Jonathan Franzen: ‘The reader is a friend, not an adversary, not a spectator.’ (I have read his books. I am his adversary.) VS Naipul says you should avoid using any adjectives other than those relating to colour, size, and number. Margaret Atwood’s are more practical. ‘Do back exercises. Pain is distracting.’ So are Hilary Mantel’s. ‘Are you serious about this? Then get an accountant.’ Geoff Dyer’s are less so. ‘Have regrets. They are fuel. On the page they flare into desire.’</p><p>Down in the most lightless depths of bad writing—among the fanfic troglodytes, or the people who assume all books come in trilogies—you’ll find an obsession with this idea of <em>rules</em>. Somewhere there is buried a vast golden lawbook of what you must and must not do. One of the worst things anyone has ever shown me is the r/writing subreddit, in which bad writers constantly, fretfully, seek permission to write. <em>Am I allowed to do an enemies to lovers story but without the romantic element? Am I allowed to set my story in a real place like New York City or will I get in trouble for copyright? Am I allowed to write a story with two different themes? I’ve heard you can’t use any speech verb except ‘said,’ but what if my character is from an alien species that doesn’t communicate through sound?</em></p><p>This is mad, but it happens for a reason. What the rules basically amount to is a list of things that bad writers do. Bad writers shove in loads of overlong and redundant words for no reason—so the rules tell you to use as few words as possible. Bad writers will inform you that their hero is incredibly funny and wise, but their talents don’t stretch to actually summoning anything funny or wise for this person to say—so the rules tell you to show, not tell. It doesn’t work; bad writing multiplies—because this is only treating the symptom. One thing I’ve noticed is that crap amateur fiction is also much more likely to feature a character called Bob. I don’t know why. Have you been outside lately? <em>Nobody</em> is called Bob. But I don’t think that instituting a rule about it—‘on no account are you to invent a Bob’—would make the actual writing any better. We’d just go through the same rigamarole with Mike instead. </p><p>Similarly, <em>breaking</em> the rules is not always the catastrophe it’s made out to be. Another habit of bad fiction writers is exposition-dumping: when you have someone deliver a long speech explaining all the relevant backstory, for reasons that are totally inscrutable within the plot but tediously obvious within the text. Usually this involves the phrase ‘as you know, sir’—as in, ‘as you know, sir, the Church of Humanity has been at war with the insect-men of Zwingli-9 for the last star-decade.’ This is always awful, and if what you want to write requires it, then it probably isn’t worth writing. Except—look at <em>Hamlet</em>, act one, scene one, and read from line 97:</p><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text"><em>Our last king, 
Whose image even but now appear'd to us, 
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, 
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, 
Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet 
(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) 
Did slay this Fortinbras...</em></pre></div><p>Clearly, this prohibition didn’t bother Shakespeare. Neither did the rules of his own day: he steadfastly refused to observe the Aristotelian unities, or even the idea that a play should be either a tragedy or a comedy and not something messily inbetween. (This, by the way, is why all the voguish right-wing Oxfordians have brain damage. Shakespeare’s problem plays, his habit of turning verbs into adjectives at will—it’s exactly what you’d expect from an incredibly brilliant but unschooled rustic, and absolutely <em>not</em> a classically educated posho like Edward de Vere.) </p><p>So: bad writing isn’t bad because it’s broken the rules. There is a deeper font of badness down there. It’s worth asking: <em>why</em> do so many terrible writers carelessly strew adverbs all over the place and saddle us with figments called Bob? It could be that this is just the natural and naïve form of writing, a kind of primordially wordy, Roberty ooze that better writers have managed to claw their way out from. But what’s more likely that this is how they’ve <em>learned</em> to write, because this is how the things they read are written. In other words, bad writers of this type have expertly adopted a particular style. And when they try to improve, all they can do is cast about for a different ready-made style to adopt, and a different set of rules to follow. </p><p>There are plenty of styles out there; the problem is that almost all of them are awful. (See above.) There isn’t really much difference between the panting, clammy man scribbling a formulaic epic about elf tits and the panting, clammy man scribbling a formulaic column about the Labour Party. The latter doesn’t even make much more money. Almost every novel in your local bookshop has not just the same literary voice, but the same <em>title</em>, which is <em>All The Little Light We Hold</em>. Not quite writing, exactly, but a premium booklike experience. You can be a sassy online critic who talks with lots of ambiguously ironic exclamation marks. You can be stridently, righteously angry, on deadline and for a fee. It doesn’t matter. Your insincerity will reek from the page. You will be dull. </p><p>In general, style is less something people <em>do</em> and more something that happens to them. One of the strangest people to have ever penned a list of rules for writers was Friedrich Nietzsche. His advice is not bad, exactly. ‘The richness of life reveals itself through a <em>richness of gestures</em>… The more abstract a truth which one wishes to teach, the more one must first <em>entice</em> the senses.’ But it’s advice for how to write <em>like Nietzsche</em>, which is something nobody else has ever managed to do succesfully, and he only managed to do by accident. Hard to imagine that Nietzsche landed on his particular style out of choice. His writing is arrogant, brilliant, and saturated with a total lack of self-awareness—strangely <em>vulnerable</em>, even in its grandest moments, so over the top and so easy to mock—and Nietzsche the man was all of those things too. (If he’d tried to write in the precise, deliberative mode of a David Hume, he simply wouldn’t have been able to do it.) When Nietzsche describes his own creative process, it sounds less like a <em>craft</em> and more like an earthquake, or a flash flood:</p><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text"><em>One hears—one does not seek; one takes—one does not ask who gives: a thought suddenly flashes up like lightning, it comes with necessity, without faltering—I have never had any choice in the matter… There is an instinct for rhythmic relations which embraces a whole world of forms. Everything happens quite involuntarily, as if in a tempestuous outburst of freedom, of absoluteness, of power and divinity.</em></pre></div><p>But you are not Nietzsche, and you’re not Shakespeare either. When a form seems to come to you involuntarily, chances are it’s not <em>Hamlet</em> or <em>Zarathustra</em>; it’s probably the bad expository novel or the bad essay about nothing in particular, breeding itself in your head. I can’t tell you how to write well; any set of rules for good writing is just the formula for a new kind of dogshit. But I can tell you how to avoid writing badly. Here are some rules for doing that.</p><h4>1. Read everything out loud</h4><p>You should not write in the way that you speak. You should absolutely not speak in the way that you write. Anyone who walks around talking in full sentences with nested clauses is a danger to themselves and others, and it’s probably for the best that they’re usually packed off to an institution. (Either a psychiatric ward or a university will do.) But <em>good</em> writing still needs to have some relation to the wet bits in the back of your throat.</p><p>James Joyce once said that everything he wrote was perfectly comprehensible if you just read it aloud, and he wasn’t lying. (I’ve found that if you really get stuck, it helps even more to read it in a kind of cartoon-leprechaun Irish accent. ‘Where bronze from anear? Where gold from afar? Where hoofs?’) Joyce could play his weird games with language because everything he wrote was still rooted in the human mouth. He put down words like <em>honorificabilitudinitatibus</em> and <em>contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality</em> and <em>biscuitfully</em>, but he knew why. ‘Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.’</p><p>It’s not enough to <em>look</em> at the words you’ve written. You need to sit in front of them, mumbling like a maniac. Any sentence that leaves you gasping for breath is bad. Sentences can still be long—it’s perfectly possible to write one that extends almost indefinitely, churning past comma after comma for pages on end, as long as it still rests and resumes roughly in time with the lungs and as long as it still has enough cracks in it for you to breathe—while short sentences, if there are enough of them closely packed together, can stifle too. This is a long sentence by Virginia Woolf, and it’s <em>gorgeous</em>:</p><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text"><em>Also the sea tosses itself and breaks itself, and should any sleeper fancying that he might find on the beach an answer to his doubts, a sharer of his solitude, throw off his bedclothes and go down by himself to walk on the sand, no image with semblance of serving and divine promptitude comes readily to hand bringing the night to order and making the world reflect the compass of the soul.</em></pre></div><p>It would not be better or clearer if it read like this instead:</p><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text"><em>The sea was rough. The beach was empty. There was no one out. You could go down there but it wouldn't be nice. The world was crazy. It didn’t make sense.</em></pre></div><p>Similarly, any cluster of words that feels <em>uncomfortable</em> to speak, like your mouth is full of pebbles, needs to go. The mistake bad writers make isn’t using long and complex words instead of short and simple ones: it’s that they use long and complex words <em>as if</em> they were short and simple. They shove some heaving polysyllabic beast into a sentence whose rhythms aren’t broad enough to accomodate it, or cram a bunch of them in there at once until the whole structure groans under the weight. ‘I looked piquantly at the pulchritudinous girl.’ In Woolf’s sentence above <em>promptitude</em> feels perfectly at home. But if you write ‘I asked Bob to help and he came with promptitude’ then you have committed an atrocity. This is what happens when you write with a thesaurus: as if words are just their meanings.</p><h4>2. Write copy</h4><p>For two years, Thomas Pynchon worked as a technical writer for Boeing. He contributed some tweny-five uncredited pieces to <em>Bomarc Service News</em>, the company’s internal newsletter, in which he wrote about hydrazine tank cartridge replacement, SCE calibration, and mercury wetted relays. His pieces are slightly funnier and more interesting than you’d expect from an article on hydrazine tank cartridge replacement, but only slightly. Mostly, they efficiently convey the necessary information, along with what the bosses at Boeing wanted their workers to think. ‘How can you become, and stay, 100% reliable? By not ever being satisfied. By picking nits that haven’t even been invented yet.’ Motivational corporate-speak: miserable. Shortly afterwards, he published <em>V</em>, which reads somewhat differently. I think these two events might not be unconnected.</p><p>There’s about a year left, maybe a year and a half, until all copywriting is done by ChatGPT. Which is a shame, because churning out the most utterly banal prose imaginable is actually a pretty decent education in writing. It doesn’t just teach you the craft of being clear and comprehensible in prose; unlike journalism or the MFA, it teaches that craft in a way that you will never mistake for art.</p><p>Copy is not <em>unstyled</em>. Even SEO is not unstyled; it’s just a style for machines. All businesses speak in the most highly ritualised and artficial style there is, whether it’s ‘Hi there! We’re McDonald’s!’ jabber or ‘rich, smooth, buttery hamburgers’ pornography. In the menagerie of prose, this stuff is the virus: hovering ambiguously on the edges of life, but perfectly formed, and swarming, and <em>effective</em>. </p><p>It’s effective most of all because it assumes nothing about the reader. Most of my early writing was some kind of glorified political column, and the point of political columns isn’t really to <em>convince</em> people of anything; it’s to provide the people who already agree with you with some readymade lines to use on their Tory uncles or pinko nephews. I wrote assuming my readers already shared all of my thoughts and opinions, which, in fact, most of them did. When I write copy, though, all I know about my reader is that they might want to eat a burger, or replace a hydrazine tank cartridge. You don’t want to say anthing that might alienate them, and this can be useful. Writing for a known audience, even if that audience is just yourself, makes you lazy. It lets you slip into familiar forms.</p><p>The point isn’t to write prose like you would write copy. This kind of writing should be an <em>innoculation</em>: once you’ve had to adopt one crap suffocating functional style, it should put you on guard against the others. Once you know how to write in a way that doesn’t alienate people, you can write in a way that only alienates people on purpose.</p><h4>3. Choose your influences</h4><p>The way you write is a product of the way you read. If you want to write well, you have to get good at reading. </p><p>You need to read fiction, even if that’s not what you write. (I can always tell when an essayist only reads other essays, because of the strong urge I get a few paragraphs in, to take the author and dunk their head in the cold ocean, shouting <em>there!</em> as they struggle and eventually drown in its hugeness, <em>there!</em> as if that would explain things.) You also need to read widely, by which I mean you need to read things from the past. Part of the whole point of reading is that it provincialises the present. Today the <em>correct</em> way of writing is blank, friendly, understated, and unadorned, but that wasn’t always the case; the essayists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries managed to be friendly, even chatty, while also writing prose that was magnificently ornate, erudite, and long-winded. Today we’re encouraged to avoid cliché at all cost, but medieval literature is practically <em>made</em> of cliché—every knight is the handsomest that ever lived, every maiden is beautiful in brocaded silks—and it’s none the worse for it. We are not right. They were not wrong. </p><p>But what I do <em>not</em> mean is that you should simply digest the entire canon and then puke it up again. That would just be another formula, and there are a lot of very good books that make absolutely terrible fodder for writing. You should not attempt to draw influence from almost anyone I’ve mentioned here: not Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Joyce, Woolf, or Pynchon. I also love Kafka, most of all because it’s impossible to read any of his stories without getting a very strong and very frantic sense of what it would have <em>been like</em> to be Kafka. He wrote in a way that could only have belonged to him, and if you try to do it yourself you’ll sound like a knockoff, which is exactly what you are. But Kafka learned to write that way by reading Heinrich von Kleist, and so can you. </p><p>I also love Didion. Her sentences were so <em>good</em> that roughly half of all published essays today are in imitation of her, or in imitation of her imitators. Almost all of that material is dogshit. Didion made it look easy; it is not easy. The world fills up with people who adopt her pose and not her prose, cigarettes and dread. If you want to write as well as she did, skip everything she ever said about herself, and instead read her essays on the Operations Control Centre for the California State Water Project and the Operations Centre at the California Department of Transport. (They’re both in <em>The White Album</em>.) Joan Didion was deeply fascinated by computerised control systems for moving around large volumes of fluid material, water or traffic. ‘An obsessive interest not in the politics of water but in the waterworks themselves, in the movement of water through aqueducts and siphons and pumps and forebays and weirs and drains, in plumbing on the grand scale.’ You’re probably not as interested in water as she was. But now you know that a deeply elegant essay about sluiceway gates is possible, and that’s all you need. </p>

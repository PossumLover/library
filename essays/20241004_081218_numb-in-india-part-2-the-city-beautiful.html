After Partition, the traditional Punjabi capital of Lahore ended up in Pakistan, and communal rioting had left much of the state in ruins. Chandigarh was the solution: a new, modern city for a new, forward-looking country. It was designed by the notorious Franco-Swiss architect Le Corbusier: you might remember him from his slightly supervillainish plan to demolish the entire Left Bank of Paris and replace it with dozens of huge, evenly-spaced cruciform housing blocks. For some reason, the Parisian authorities never let him follow through on that one, but Nehru gave him Chandigarh: the largest single project he ever completed, a city-sized laboratory for his ideas. Locals call Chandigarh <em>the city beautiful</em>, and they’re right. It is beautiful. I just worry that it might also be a psychic interface communicating with the unknown entity at the heart of the Sun. </p><p>A lot of people respond very negatively to Le Corbusier, and I do understand why. His real name was Charles-Édouard, but he insisted that everyone call him by a made-up name that essentially translates as <em>The Crowlike One</em>. This is annoying. His designs make heavy use of raw concrete, which not everyone finds appealing, and he supported the Nazis. He had a habit of making big, airy, arsey pronouncements, and if you’re not predisposed to like him I can get why these might get under your skin. ‘The curve is ruinous, difficult and dangerous; it is a paralysing thing. The straight line enters into all human history, into all human aims, into every human act.’ That sort of thing. </p><p>Critics have detected something deeply authoritarian in Le Corbusier’s efforts to replace all haphazard, organic, democratic forms with a world of summarily imposed right-angles and grids. The late James C Scott, for instance, made Le Corbusier one of the chief villains of his book <em>Seeing Like A State</em>, which is about all the ways big top-down ‘scientific’ projects to improve the world have ended up making things drastically worse. So he cites the example of Brasilia: another planned capital built on Le Corbusier’s principles, ‘conceived as a city of the future, a city of development, a realisable utopia. It made no reference to the habits, traditions, and practices of Brazil’s past or its great cities.’ In particular, it lacked<em> </em>streets, the sense of a universal public space with no strict function except whatever you feel like doing today. In most Brazilian cities, the street is where children play, friends drink coffee, traders do their business, men and women discover each other; where religion and revolution are preached, and sometimes enacted. Brasilia has no streets, ‘only roads and highways.’ The plan provides for everything; nothing unplanned can ever take place. But every human life is made up of a million accidental miracles, and Brasilia is no place for human life. Today, it’s virtually abandoned; anyone who can moves to the more gregarious suburbs. Scott devotes a long section of his book to Brasilia. Chandigarh, meanwhile, barely gets a single page in my edition. This is strange, since unlike Brasilia, Chandigarh was designed by Le Corbusier himself, rather than his followers. Maybe the problem is that unlike Brasilia, Chandigarh <em>works</em>.</p><p>It’s nice here: overwhelmingly nice. In Sector 17, the downtown zone, a network of open passages leads between generous chowks where families wander around on a Saturday night, eating ice cream, listening to street musicians. Apparently the city has a big microbrew culture. There’s a wide underpass beneath one of the main arterial highways, where ten-year-old kids practice their rollerblading. On the other side there’s an immaculate park so muscular Sikhs can jog around the enormous fountain in the Sunday-morning cool. On the highway above, cars wait for the green light at intersections and everyone wears their seatbelt. There are no piles of refuse on the streets in Chandigarh. No wandering urban cattle. (To be fair, one person has given the entire city a one-star Google rating and added that ‘the name should be changed from “The city beautiful” to “THE CITY OF STRAY DOGS.”’) As you leave Delhi the train heaves past the slums, the truly desperate places, where every family home is a brick cube eight feet in each direction, without windows or water or electricity, just the baking fetid air and a mattress on the floor, and there are huge tracts of city that are nothing but these brick coffins piled on top of each other like a heap of Lego, all of them in a sea of stinking plastic waste that surges against each dark and doorless door. There’s nothing like that in Chandigarh. The city has some informal settlements on its outskirts and a few warrenlike old villages engulfed in its grid, but the vast majority of the migrant workers live in multi-room apartments in concrete blocks, with greenery all around them and big glass windows that let in lots of light.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88127fc9-c87b-404e-8b77-1e4ab9bad2f0_3909x2930.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88127fc9-c87b-404e-8b77-1e4ab9bad2f0_3909x2930.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88127fc9-c87b-404e-8b77-1e4ab9bad2f0_3909x2930.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88127fc9-c87b-404e-8b77-1e4ab9bad2f0_3909x2930.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88127fc9-c87b-404e-8b77-1e4ab9bad2f0_3909x2930.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88127fc9-c87b-404e-8b77-1e4ab9bad2f0_3909x2930.jpeg" width="1456" height="1091" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/88127fc9-c87b-404e-8b77-1e4ab9bad2f0_3909x2930.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1091,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2396689,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88127fc9-c87b-404e-8b77-1e4ab9bad2f0_3909x2930.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88127fc9-c87b-404e-8b77-1e4ab9bad2f0_3909x2930.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88127fc9-c87b-404e-8b77-1e4ab9bad2f0_3909x2930.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88127fc9-c87b-404e-8b77-1e4ab9bad2f0_3909x2930.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The big monumental zones of Chandigarh are incontrovertibly beautiful. There’s a certain type of person that can’t see a bit of raw concrete without frothing about ugliness and decadence and the plot to enslave the soul of western man, and they always seem to think I’m being some kind of devious contrarian when I say I find this stuff straightforwardly aesthetically pleasing, but I do, and I’m right. If you can’t appreciate the value of clean lines and pure geometric forms, I don’t really feel any need to take your opinions seriously. So far, I’ve never seen anyone actually explain <em>why</em> modern architecture is so intrinsically ugly. According to the traditional definition, beauty is symmetry, harmony, and proportion, and Le Corbusier’s buildings have all of those. The museums he designed for Chandigarh are gorgeous spaces, airy, well-proportioned. His Palace of Assembly is a masterpiece: the lawmakers sit under an enormous funnel, bands and blobs of colour rising into an almost infinite blackness that towers above the parliamentarians in their seats and makes all these grandees look very, very small. It conjures an awe I’ve only experienced in a few very old cathedrals. But maybe my favourite thing here is the Tower of Shadows, and not just for its cool sinister name. The Tower consists of two open concrete-lattice cubes stacked on top of each other, but the slats are positioned at a very precise angle relative to the Sun. In the summer, they ensure that the Tower is always in the shade at any time of day; in the winter, when the Sun is lower in the sky, the light streams in. The entire form of the building is given by invisible lines of sunlight, rendered in concrete. If you can’t find that beautiful, I think something might be missing in your soul.</p><p>It’s the other parts of Chandigarh I find harder to explain. The bits that aren’t UNESCO world heritage sites, where the city has been left to develop along its own path. This place is—there’s no other word for it—<em>Californian</em>. A hazy, pastel vision of Southern California, self-assembling on the flat fields of the Punjab. It’s in the long, straight, palm-lined avenues, the traffic zooming through a city built less to be lived in and more to be driven through. Music leaks out the open windows at red lights: bhangra vocals over a G-funk beat. The road runs straight forever, but past vanishing point great green mountains loom. For a moment you could pretend they’re the San Gabriels, not the first foothills of the Himalayas from which the Ganges flows. Around sunset everyone gathers by the lake. All the politicians used to be singers or movie stars. We are in Los Angeles. Just <em>look</em> at this place:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc86070d-9fe6-4d94-9b87-be7fd6d1b4d6_3705x2779.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc86070d-9fe6-4d94-9b87-be7fd6d1b4d6_3705x2779.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc86070d-9fe6-4d94-9b87-be7fd6d1b4d6_3705x2779.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc86070d-9fe6-4d94-9b87-be7fd6d1b4d6_3705x2779.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc86070d-9fe6-4d94-9b87-be7fd6d1b4d6_3705x2779.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc86070d-9fe6-4d94-9b87-be7fd6d1b4d6_3705x2779.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bc86070d-9fe6-4d94-9b87-be7fd6d1b4d6_3705x2779.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2778847,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc86070d-9fe6-4d94-9b87-be7fd6d1b4d6_3705x2779.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc86070d-9fe6-4d94-9b87-be7fd6d1b4d6_3705x2779.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc86070d-9fe6-4d94-9b87-be7fd6d1b4d6_3705x2779.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc86070d-9fe6-4d94-9b87-be7fd6d1b4d6_3705x2779.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>But maybe I’ve got things backwards. After all, India is older than California, and the first Europeans had barely settled on the eastern shore of the Pacific when they suddenly started getting obsessed with Hindu mysticism. Swami Vivekananda could draw huge crowds in Los Angeles when it was still a cow town. Something of India repeats itself there. We’ll return to this mystery eventually, but as it happens, Chandigarh is not India’s first planned city laid out on a perfect grid. Le Corbusier might have thought he was replacing the irrational squalor of the Indian city with a new and pure form, but actually he was part of a long tradition. Two centuries before Le Corbusier, and fifty years before the United States of America, there was Sawai Jai Singh II, the great king who discovered how to communicate with the Sun, and learned what it said, and lived in abject terror for two years until he died. </p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f623e0e-dce7-46fe-b61c-385e22efb91a_3024x2268.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f623e0e-dce7-46fe-b61c-385e22efb91a_3024x2268.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f623e0e-dce7-46fe-b61c-385e22efb91a_3024x2268.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f623e0e-dce7-46fe-b61c-385e22efb91a_3024x2268.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f623e0e-dce7-46fe-b61c-385e22efb91a_3024x2268.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f623e0e-dce7-46fe-b61c-385e22efb91a_3024x2268.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8f623e0e-dce7-46fe-b61c-385e22efb91a_3024x2268.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1770046,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f623e0e-dce7-46fe-b61c-385e22efb91a_3024x2268.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f623e0e-dce7-46fe-b61c-385e22efb91a_3024x2268.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f623e0e-dce7-46fe-b61c-385e22efb91a_3024x2268.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f623e0e-dce7-46fe-b61c-385e22efb91a_3024x2268.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Because it was planned in the eighteenth rather than the twentieth century, everyone agrees that Sawai Jai Singh’s city of Jaipur is beautiful. The new city is all in blue-tinted glass, brash and prosperous: it has entire neighbourhoods where everyone seems to be competing to build the house that screams loudest to anyone passing by: <em>yes, if you go inside, you will find a Louis Vuitton-print dining table</em>. But the reason I couldn’t avoid Jaipur, the reason this place is so embedded in the tourist trail, is the old city. And it’s very nice, all wide streets and orange arcades, but it absolutely looks like it was made on an assembly line. Le Corbusier couldn’t have done better. Everything is in the same colour, all built to a plan, and all streets meet at right angles. If they’d had reinforced concrete in 1727 you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. Still, Jaipur is full of grand palaces, seemingly all of which were built by some lecherous maharajah to hide his favourite concubine from his least favourite wife. The grandest of them all is the City Palace, which is partially open as a museum but still serves as the official residence of the heirs of Sawai Jai Singh. The current unofficial maharajah (India formally abolished all princely titles in 1971) is Padmanabh Singh, born 1998, the zoomer monarch. Padmanabh I has half a million followers on Instagram, property worth two billion US dollars, and a small collection of trophies from his career as a professional polo player. If you shell out a little extra, you can see those trophies on display at the City Palace, alongside a lot of photos of Padmanabh looking handsome for various glossy magazines. There are also some pictures of his sister Gauravi, who studied communications at NYU and interned at PAPER magazine and looks like she’s definitely described herself as a POC at some point in her life. They belong to the Kachwaha clan, which has ruled this corner of Rajasthan for nearly a thousand years. Their ancestors used to fight in wars; they trailed blood from Samarkand to Assam. They used to do much weirder things with horses than play polo.</p><p>Traditionally, the Kachwaha clan claim to be a cadet branch of the Suryavanshi dynasty which ruled during the heroic age of Hindu legend. The Suryavanshi are named after their ancestor Surya, the Sun. Surya was one of the old gods, the Vedic gods, like Indra and Agni and Mitra and Varuna and Aryaman, who took animal sacrifices in steaming blood, back when Shiva was a minor storm-god and Vishnu was barely a footnote in the pantheon. When a god was something raw and fierce out the bowels of the earth or a great wound blazing in the sky. Surya rides in a war-chariot pulled by seven white horses and impregnates women with his thick burning beams of light. The more prosaic history is that the Kachwahas were a gang of armed peasants who staked out a little fiefdom and spent the next half a millennium fighting every other rajput clan for the right to terrorise its populace. When the Mughals came, though, things changed. The reigning Kachwaha died fighting Babur’s conquest of India; afterwards his son submitted to the invaders and ended up dying fighting <em>alongside</em> the Mughal emperor. For hundreds of years after that, every Mughal emperor had an eager Kachwaha vassal to offer their swords in war and their daughters in marriage. In return, they got lands and governorships and wealth. That was the system. It worked, sort of, until it didn’t.</p><p>Jai’s father was Raja Bishan Singh, who spent his entire life as the plaything of the world-historically cranky Emperor Aurangzeb. When Bishan came to his throne in 1688, he was sixteen years old and Aurangzeb was nearly seventy, grasping and unsatisfied, sending constant streams of people to their deaths for more land. He called himself Alamgir: lord of the entire world. At this point he’d already stripped the Kachwahas of most of their privileges; previous rajas had sometimes hesitated before willingly dying in his service. On Bishan’s ascension, the emperor immediately ordered his teenage vassal stamp out a major Jat rebellion around Agra. Years of picking off forts and intervening in skirmishes between minor clans. When it was done, Aurangzeb ordered him to go south and fight in the Deccan War, his multi-decade-long counter-insurgency meat-grinder against the Marathas. The Deccan was a seventeenth-century Vietnam, which chewed up half the noble houses in India. (At one point, Aurangzeb had managed to capture the Maratha king. He cut out his tongue and his eyes, and spent the next few weeks slowly hacking and slicing before finally removing his enemy’s head. Somehow, this failed to end the insurgency.) Bishan spent two years trying to avoid the order while sending surreptitious draft-avoidance bribes to the imperial family, until eventually Aurangzeb got impatient. Since Bishan wouldn’t go south, he was sent to fight in Afghanistan instead. He arrived in Kandahar in the middle of a bitterly cold winter and died almost immediately. He was twenty-six years old. When it was his son Jai’s turn to fall into the claws of Aurangzeb, he had just turned eleven.</p><p>Jai inherited a kingdom that was bankrupt and depopulated from decades of war, but when Aurangzeb sent him to the Deccan he went, and started winning. Over his reign Jai won a lot of battles for the Mughals and received a lot of rewards, but the empire was rotting from the inside out, and he knew it. His task was to build something that would survive the lords of the entire world when they fell. He buttered up the Mughal princes when it suited him, made himself indispensable, but meanwhile he fortified his own kingdom, hatched secret alliances. He built his new, austere, mathematically gridded city of Jaipur. Finally, he performed Ashvamedha.</p><p>The Ashvamedha is an ancient Vedic horse-sacrifice. One of the hymns of the 3,400-year-old Rig Veda is dedicated to the rite. ‘The axe penetrates the thirty-four ribs of the swift horse; the beloved of the gods. There is one immolator of the radiant horse, which is Time; there are two that hold him fast; such of your limbs as I cut up in due season, I offer them.’ But the actual killing of the horse was maybe the least significant part of the ritual. It’s a rite for kings and warlords from a redder, deadlier time, when the gods were raw and new. It’s all power, crude Bronze Age my-stick-is-bigger-than-yours power. This is the procedure. For one year before it’s killed, the black and white horse is allowed to roam freely over the sacrificer’s lands, attended by four hundred warriors. If at any point it wanders into someone else’s territory, the sacrificer is required to conquer that land. If anyone wants to dispute the sacrificer’s sovereignty, they can try to kill the horse. If nobody manages to do so, the horse is led home, bathed, rubbed in ghee, and strangled to death. Then, the body of the horse is laid on a blanket, and the king’s first wife lies down beside it, opens her legs, and fucks the corpse. </p><p>That last bit is unexpected. It gives the ritual a touch of gruesome mystery. For Sawai Jai Singh, performing Ashvamedha was about political sovereignty, wresting his new state out of the shadow of the Mughals, reviving a sense of Hindu kingship from the far end of written history. But what about his wife? What does it mean to have sex with a dead horse? What’s going on? Our best source for this is the <em>Satapatha Brahmana</em>, a compendium of detailed descriptions of Vedic rituals from roughly the seventh century BC. In the <em>Satapatha Brahmana</em>, the entire ritual becomes something different, more cosmic. The horse is not just a horse. It’s a metaphor; it’s everything. ‘The Ashvamedha is the king of sacrifices. But, indeed, the Ashvamedha is the sacrificer, for the sacrifice is the sacrificer: he becomes the sacrifice.’ The ritual blurs the boundary between the horse and the king himself: he has to conquer every country the horse sets foot in, while the horse gets to enjoy his wife, even if at that point its capacity for enjoyment is limited. Ultimately, the king is slaughtering himself. But it’s bigger than that: the horse is also a god, or something greater than a god. The <em>Satapatha Brahmana</em> is full of odes to the cosmic significance of horses. ‘Now the gods, when going upwards, did not know the way to the heavenly world, but the horse knew it: when they go upwards with the horse, it is in order to know the way to the heavenly world.’ The book explains that the creator-god Prajapati made the<em> months of the year</em> out of the lifeblood of a horse. Time, including calendar time, is just a function of speed, and speed is just a function of the swiftest.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> Horsedeath is the fire that kindled the Sun. When you bathe the horse before its sacrifice, you tell it: ‘Surya was an animal; they sacrificed him, and he gained that world where Surya rules: that will be your world, that will you gain.’ </p><p>In other words, having sex with a dead horse means <em>having sex with the Sun</em>. A union with the generative fire at the heart of the universe. According to the <em>Satapatha Brahmana</em>, when the queen lies down next to the horse, she cries: ‘May the vigorous male, layer of seed, lay seed!’ </p><p>This is not a common ritual. Only one person has actually performed Ashvamedha in the last thousand years, and it’s Sawai Jai Singh II. The <em>other</em> thing he’s known for is the Jantar Mantar, a collection of enormous astronomical instruments he used to precisely measure the movements of the Sun. In the light of his other activities, this huge observatory seems like it might have had some secret purpose. An array of scientific sensors, all pointed at the great dead horse in the sky: his ancestor, his wife’s lover, and his god.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72cb0b98-4de0-45df-94d1-e0ab935eaf86_4008x3006.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72cb0b98-4de0-45df-94d1-e0ab935eaf86_4008x3006.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72cb0b98-4de0-45df-94d1-e0ab935eaf86_4008x3006.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72cb0b98-4de0-45df-94d1-e0ab935eaf86_4008x3006.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72cb0b98-4de0-45df-94d1-e0ab935eaf86_4008x3006.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72cb0b98-4de0-45df-94d1-e0ab935eaf86_4008x3006.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/72cb0b98-4de0-45df-94d1-e0ab935eaf86_4008x3006.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3249231,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72cb0b98-4de0-45df-94d1-e0ab935eaf86_4008x3006.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72cb0b98-4de0-45df-94d1-e0ab935eaf86_4008x3006.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72cb0b98-4de0-45df-94d1-e0ab935eaf86_4008x3006.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72cb0b98-4de0-45df-94d1-e0ab935eaf86_4008x3006.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I really did try to understand the Jantar Mantar. It’s a beautiful garden just south of the City Palace that looks like the best skate park on the planet. Somehow, this thicket of strange curving shapes and hundred-foot gnomons could measure minuscule movements in the cosmos, but while the garden is full of explanatory signs, they were not always much help. At least some of them appeared to be in the sludgy half-writing you get when an AI image generator tries to produce text. ‘Goknlchand Bhawan: The nse of hiis instrnment is to find the declinauon Pil distance frem the eclipuc and equiunk of the snn am siars.’ The ones that <em>were</em> in fully readable English weren’t much better. ‘The shadow of the triangular wall, which is placed in the North-South direction with an angle equal to the latitude of this location (27 degrees North) moves equal distances on the eastern and western side quadrants. The ring represents the horizon while the two arcs allow the Zenith to be determined when the Sun crosses the Local Meridian. This instrument helps calculate local time, plus Distance, Declination of Altitude of heavenly bodies.’ Great. But actually watching them work helps. On the Samrat Yantra, the largest sundial ever built, you can see the shadows moving from one notch in the marble to another. It gives the time to within two seconds.</p><p>King Jai was an extremely eager scholar. He studied the usual classical Indian mathematicians, Aryabhata, Brahmugupta, Bhaskaracharya, but he also sponsored the translation of scientific texts into Sanskrit, including Euclid’s <em>Elements</em>, Ptolemey’s <em>Almagest</em>, the <em>Spherica</em> of Theodosius, the <em>Tadhkira </em>of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, the <em>Zij-i-Sultani </em>of Ulugh Beg, Philippe de La Hire’s <em>Tabulae Astronomicae</em>, Isaac Newton’s <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, and John Flamsteed’s <em>Historia Coelestis Britannica</em>. He invited Europeans to view his instruments, and improve them if necessary. At the time, the European power most involved in India was Portugal, with its colony in Goa; they sent a delegation of Jesuits. It turned out that Jai’s instruments could predict eclipses more accurately than the priests, who were forbidden from taking advantage of Copernican theory. But there are some things mysteriously missing from his garden of astronomical devices. The telescope had been known in Europe for well over a century when the Jantar Mantar was built, and Robert Hooke had made the first reflector back in 1673, but Jai never attempted to acquire one, or showed any interest in optics of any kind. From his studies he must have been aware of its existence, but the thought of seeing the rings of Saturn or stars invisible to the naked eye left him weirdly unmoved. Could it be that he never bothered with the telescope because he had something <em>better</em>?</p><p>Another piece of information that might not mean anything at all: like a lot of men of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Jai’s education in science was combined with an equally extensive education in mysticism. Vedic and Islamic astrology, Persian and Arabic books on dreams, ecstatic trances, the souls of objects, communication with djinn. This is the man who revived the three-thousand-year-old Ashvamedha. The tradition he was reaching back into contains the idea that the Sun is in some sense <em>alive</em>, that it’s a thinking conscious entity, and its life has something to do with the life and death of living creatures here on Earth. The conventional narrative says that Jai Singh II built a new city called Jaipur on a strict scientific grid, and inside that city he built the Jantar Mantar, a set of astronomical instruments. But I think that might be the wrong way round. The entire city of Jaipur is <em>part</em> of the Jantar Mantar. Its grid collecting and channeling some unknown psychic energy from the tens of thousands of courtiers and administrators and traders and lackeys and workers that were made to live inside this vast machine, sending it all coursing towards the stone instruments at the heart of the city, which then direct it in one continuous beam directly at the heart of the Sun. I think Jai was trying to communicate with his ancestor, and I think he succeeded. I think the Sun spoke to him. I don’t think he liked what it said. </p><p>In 1741, Sawai Jai suddenly stopped visiting the Jantar Mantar, withdrew from public life, and hid away in his palaces, bitter and feverish, afraid. According to the great poet and historian Kavikalanidhi Shrikrishna Bhatt, who’d been invited to Jaipur to lead its artistic renaissance and record the deeds of its king, Jai started spending all day in the Govind Dev Ji, a temple within the palace precincts dedicated to Krishna and Radha, the gods of compassion, tenderness, mercy, and love. He prayed with desperation. Tears and drool splattered over his face. Bhatt writes that he was despondent after his defeat in the Battle of Gangwana, one of the few he ever suffered. More likely, he lost the battle because he was despondent. Sawai Jai Singh II died in 1743, at the age of 54. His wives all committed sati. His sons neglected his scientific instruments, melted down the reflecting silver, and burned many of his papers. They spent the next three hundred years making war, playing polo, building palaces, and marrying beauty queens.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7300a204-17e1-4756-870e-853c5100c95d_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7300a204-17e1-4756-870e-853c5100c95d_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7300a204-17e1-4756-870e-853c5100c95d_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7300a204-17e1-4756-870e-853c5100c95d_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7300a204-17e1-4756-870e-853c5100c95d_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7300a204-17e1-4756-870e-853c5100c95d_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7300a204-17e1-4756-870e-853c5100c95d_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3562363,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7300a204-17e1-4756-870e-853c5100c95d_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7300a204-17e1-4756-870e-853c5100c95d_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7300a204-17e1-4756-870e-853c5100c95d_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7300a204-17e1-4756-870e-853c5100c95d_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>That should have been the end of it. But then there was Chandigarh. Another Indian city on a perfect planned grid, that <em>just so happens</em> to include something called the Tower of Shadow, a large concrete instrument precisely attuned to the movements of the Sun. If the message that destroyed Sawai Jai Singh II can be found anywhere, it’s probably here.</p><p>And there is something. </p><p>Nek Chand was born in 1924 in a village in what’s now the Pakistani Punjab. During Partition in 1947, he and his family had to flee for their lives; like a lot of refugees, he ended up being resettled in the new planned city of Chandigarh. Chand found a job as a roads inspector for the Public Works Department. Monitoring the highways for potholes. He stayed in the job for decades. A good job for someone diligent, hard-working, mild-mannered, and unimaginative. But in 1975, the city authorities discovered that he had been doing something weird. For eighteen years, he had been secretly going into a strip of protected woodland just south of Le Corbusier’s government complex, and building his own little fantasy world there out of discarded materials. He’d dug ravines in the forest and filled them with strange figures. Little girls with cement faces and clothes made from smashed-up pottery. Skinny grinning cattle. Peacocks, flamingoes, sadhus, farmers, and weirder shapes, geometric abstractions with heads emerging at odd angles. During the day. Chand scoured the city for interesting materials, bits of glass or pottery, pretty rocks, scraps for his vision. At night he was pouring cement. The big modernist projects in Chandigarh had taught him what you could do with the stuff, but his vision was different. For a long time, even his wife didn’t know. When his project was finally discovered, it spread over thirteen acres of winding channels and secret courtyards. </p><p>British people like to believe that we’re uniquely culturally tolerant of eccentricity. All those harmless Victorian village parsons, tinkering away. But I think we’re nothing next to India. Every single person I’ve met in this country has been, in their own way, utterly mad. India can be deeply intolerant when it comes to questions of caste and creed, but it’s also incredibly indulgent of personal weirdness. Nek Chand’s bizarre personal project was totally illegal; the obvious thing for Chandigarh’s local government to do, once they found out, about it was to tear it all down and slap a fat punitive fine on its architect. Instead, after some deliberation, they decided to offer him an annual pension and thirty paid workers to keep going.</p><p>The result is Chandigarh’s rock garden, which might be the most genuinely wonderful place I’ve visited in my life. Nek Chand built a fairy kingdom, all waterfalls and secret passages, palaces heaped on each other, bridges and tunnels winding through the forest, turning unexpected corners into hidden grottoes full of his weird half-smiling figures. Like a tropical Gaudí landscape witnessed in a dream. At one point the pathway opens up onto a huge plaza with an amphitheatre, a bandstand, mosaic walls, an aquarium, a hall of mirrors, and a long looping colonnade, with dozens of swings hanging from the entablature and dozens of gloriously weird sculptures of horses arranged on top. This was Nek Chand’s gift to the people of Chandigarh: a place that exists entirely to delight. Sometimes people like to contrast it to the strict rectilinear forms of Le Corbusier’s city, but as far as I’m concerned they’re really the same kind of thing: one man’s singular vision, a semi-mystical plan exactingly rendered in concrete. But where did Nek Chand’s vision come from? <em>Why</em> did he dedicate his life to making these strange and beautiful holes in the ground?</p><p>It’s strangely hard to get a clear answer on this. An article in the <em>Guardian</em> suggests that Chand was trying to recreate the bucolic Punjabi village life of his childhood, and the entire work is ultimately an attempt to repair the trauma of Partition. Which is entirely plausible, but it’s also exactly the kind of explanation you’d <em>expect</em> to find in an article in the Guardian. Chand himself tilted towards a more mystical understanding of his own work. His original title for his garden was <em>The Kingdom of Gods and Goddesses</em>. Indian sources persistently describe the garden as a recreation of the ‘divine kingdom of Sukrani,’ although I haven’t been able to find any reference to a divine kingdom of Sukrani that isn’t describing Chand’s work. Maybe he made it up. (The <em>Sukraniti</em> is an ancient Hindu treatise on statecraft.) Sometimes—and it’s not clear how metaphorical he was being—Chand said the rock garden had come to him from the gods, or that he’d seen it in his dreams. This is a possibility we should take seriously. Is it a coincidence that in a city built from gridlines feeding into a solar interface, someone should start receiving extraplanetary schematics? Is it a coincidence that in a city called Chandigarh, literally <em>Chand’s fortress</em>, this message should be received by a person called Nek Chand?</p><p>There’s an obvious discrepancy. Whatever it was that Jai received from the Sun, it destroyed him. Chand, meanwhile, turned the same message into a gorgeous theme park. Maybe Surya’s secret is more frightening to some people than others. We can only guess at its content, but I have a theory. Sawai Jai Singh believed in an orderly universe, governed by the mathematical laws of space and time, the moral laws of dharma and karma, and the careful gradations of the caste system. Everything has its own place and its own rightful function. Whatever we do, good or bad, it’s all totted up in the great cosmic ledger, where every debt is always eventually paid. Jai built his city in straight lines. He built the most accurate sundial in the world. But he also started messing around with the rites of the Vedic religion that came before Hinduism, and its universe is very different. When the people of the Vedic era tried to imagine the divine world, they saw horses. Big white horses, dying majestically through eternity. An erotic world of chaos and speed. Surya’s secret is that there’s no pattern to any of it. The gods generate an infinity of forms for no reason; they make and devour the world for no reason; they give us the pleasures and tragedies of life for no reason at all. The gods do not create the world like a king laying out a planned city; they create like the vigorous male, layer of seed, laying seed. It’s all just one senseless gallop through every permutation of the possible. You can despair at this, and I wouldn’t blame you. But if you want, you can also take a few of the shapes that fall like ashes from the blind, charging, dead-horse gods, and create in a way the gods cannot: use them to build your garden.</p><p></p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>There’s another fantastic detail: the <em>Satapatha Brahmana </em>declares that Prajapati rules two worlds, the world of the gods and the world of men, but his rulership comes from <em>consuming animals</em>. Domesticated animals give him power over the earthly world; wild animals give him power over the divine world. This makes sense. A wild animal is always slightly indistinguishable from a god. But what this means is that if you sacrifice wild animals to the god, <em>the universe becomes wilder</em>. ‘The roads would run asunder, the village-boundaries of two villages would be far asunder; and there would come to be monsters, man-tigers, thieves, murderers, and robbers in the forests.’ Sacrificing domesticated animals returns the earthly world to Prajapati’s control. ‘Were he to complete the sacrifice with tame ones, the roads would run together, the village-boundaries of two villages would be contiguous, and no monsters would come to be in the forests.’</p><p></p></div></div>

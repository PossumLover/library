reality is that it’s now possible to start Substack beef with the <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;U.S. Department of State&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:4785194,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;pub&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/statedept&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ff9d8bac-c4f8-4cd6-9b0f-e78293f3be80_1280x1280.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;7d8fdc06-0c5e-460e-ab30-cd3980e3c99f&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span>. This is obviously what I will now be doing. My enemies list is long, and yes, you’re on it, but unlike most ordinary opinion-barfers the State Department has the power to have me kidnapped from my home in the middle of the night and secreted away to a tropical island, where cold-eyed men in greasy wifebeaters will electrocute my nuts on a zinc table until I die. A good literary beef should always come with an element of danger: if you’re not fighting someone who has the <em>ability</em> to humiliate you, you probably need to set your sights a little higher. The State Department has left a trail of blood and gore over every inhabited continent. It’s probably the biggest game out there. Let’s go.</p><p>At the end of last month, the State Department posted a meandering little Substack essay titled <em><a href="https://statedept.substack.com/p/the-need-for-civilizational-allies-in-europe">The Need for Civilisational Allies in Europe</a></em>. It writes:</p><p><em>The close relationship between the United States and Europe transcends geographic proximity and transactional politics. It represents a unique bond forged in common culture, faith, familial ties, mutual assistance in times of strife, and above all, a shared Western civilisational heritage.</em></p><p><em>Our transatlantic partnership is underpinned by a rich Western tradition of natural law, virtue ethics, and national sovereignty. This tradition flows from Athens and Rome, through medieval Christianity, to English common law, and ultimately into America's founding documents. The Declaration’s revolutionary assertion that men ‘are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights’ echoes the thought of Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and other European heavyweights who recognised that all men possess natural rights that no government can arbitrate or deny. America remains indebted to Europe for this intellectual and cultural legacy.</em></p><p><em>In the aftermath of two devastating world wars, European nations sought to prevent future catastrophes by creating supranational structures that would bind nations closer together and allow for more substantial diplomatic and economic engagements. Proponents of this new order, including well-meaning Christian and pro-democracy parties, sought a grand transformation—a world that would transcend the divisiveness of nationality and creed to usher in an era of unprecedented peace. By overcoming the anchors of nationhood, culture, and tradition, global liberalism promised what Francis Fukuyama famously called the “end of history,” the ultimate innovation of political life.</em></p><p><em>Today, this promise lies in tatters. What endures instead is an aggressive campaign against Western civilisation itself. Across Europe, governments have weaponised political institutions against their own citizens and against our shared heritage. Far from strengthening democratic principles, Europe has devolved into a hotbed of digital censorship, mass migration, restrictions on religious freedom, and numerous other assaults on democratic self-governance.</em></p><p>The rest of the piece details what they mean by this, which is that people can face legal consequences for praying silently near abortion clinics in Britain, criticising politicians in Germany, or embezzling public funds in France. To be honest, I don’t disagree that a lot of these European speech restrictions are bad and unhelpful, although I don’t see why the current US administration, with its policy of arresting and deporting people who write op-eds it doesn’t like, gets to be smug about this. What really interests me right now, though, are these four paragraphs. The writing is obviously awful; all government communiques might have the same bland, humourless, flatulent tone, but this is probably the first to describe Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas as ‘heavyweights.’ The ideas are similarly unimpressive, a wet glob of regurgitated Western Civ 101. But it’s very worrying if this is what the people who currently run the empire are thinking, because absolutely every claim made over the course of these four paragraphs is completely and utterly wrong.</p><p>America and Europe are not both part of something called ‘Western civilisation.’ America is not a product of European traditions transplanted to the New World; in fact, it’s the other way round. More than 1,500 years ago, America created Europe. There really is something genuinely distinctive about Europe, but it has absolutely nothing to do with natural law, virtue ethics, national sovereignty, culture, or tradition, and a lot more to do with the supranational structures that the State Department accuses of undermining Europe’s own values. The world is much, much weirder than the State Department—whose work mostly consists of obliterating small bit of it—could ever imagine.</p><p>Let’s start at the beginning. The notion of ‘Western civilisation’ is almost exclusively an American one; Europeans simply do not talk in these terms, unless we’re trying to cash in on the American culture wars. Like most bad ideas, it exists to make you ignore what’s right in front of your face, which is that the United States of America is not a European society, but an <em>American</em> one. </p><p>In its culture, institutions, and style of government, the US has no resemblance to France or Denmark, but it does look quite a lot like the Iroquois Confederation or the Aztec Triple Alliance. European countries are integral and territorial: each one is essentially a patch of farmland that could be conquered and defended by some warlord at some point between 476 and 1945, along with its population of bonded serfs. The basic unit of American sovereignty, meanwhile, is the <em>pact</em>, in which various disparate peoples invent institutions for globbing together in a theoretically limitless affiliative chain. The United States is also theoretically limitless: it bubbled away across the continent and then, once it hit the sea, started sweeping over Pacific islands like a tsunami. It may yet swallow up Canada too. This is entirely different to the process in which European territories are expanded or nibbled away at through conquest: the territory is simply wherever the pact is in force. </p><p>European society is literate and literary; America is fundamentally imagistic. A country of cave-painters. For the few Americans who <em>can</em> read, the written word is still magical in nature, a charm or amulet, a form of medicine, rather than an ordinary system for relaying meaning. (See, for instance, the basically savage invocation of Aristotle and Aquinas above.) For Europeans, freedom is imagined in social and sadistic terms; for Americans, both before and after Columbus, the notion of freedom is based in a metaphor of physically ranging unimpeded over large tracts of land.</p><p>The original founders of the United States understood this entirely, which is why the Sons of Liberty dressed as Native Americans when they threw the Dartmouth’s cargo into Boston Harbour. The 1778 Articles of Confederation may have been substantially inspired by the Gayanashagowa or Great Law of Peace that cemented the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, but unfortunately by 1787 the project was entirely in the hands of Roman Republic cosplayers like John Adams, with the result that most accounts of the origins of American liberalism now involve this tedious traipse from Athens to Rome to Runnymede to Plymouth Rock. There have always been a few visionaries, like Walt Whitman, who saw things clearly, but only recently have people really started pointing out the obvious. The strongest counter-history is the Graeber-Wengrow thesis, which observes that at the moment of contact between Europeans and Americans, the Europeans mostly lived under systems of extreme and explicit hierarchy and domination, while the Americans mostly lived in deliberative communities, governed by elected councils, in which any chieftain’s orders could be countermanded by someone asking ‘Why?’ (Another feature is the democratisation of violence: in Europe, the state could impose hideous punishments, but in America a whole village might collectively torture you to death.) Our entire notion of freedom, they claim, originates here. </p><p>Graeber and Wengrow don’t argue that Americans are noble savages, <em>intrinsically</em> more free than Europeans; they locate the origin of liberalism in a specifically American political history centring on the collapse of the despotic, city-building, human-sacrificing state based in Cahokia, near present-day St Louis. This might be true, but it’s worth pointing out that where contemporary America is brutal and despotic, it’s brutal and despotic in a specifically <em>American</em> way. Most European societies (after Rome, obviously) never had a sizeable domestic population of slaves; American ones did. Power in American societies was often embodied in potlatches or nextlaoallis, spectacular squanderings of wealth or life. This is essentially how the American world-empire, which continually consumes the wealth of the entire planet, governs itself. </p><p>The liberal counterpart to the reactionary slog back to Aristotle is, of course, the idea that America is a settler-colonial state built on stolen land. This is not entirely untrue—there’s been significant population turnover—but it is unhelpful. The point should be to encourage settler-descendants to more completely integrate into American society. Three hundred million Elizabeth Warrens! The first step would be to replace English the language of government and commerce with one or more native languages. Navajo has the most speakers, but Mohawk would have an obvious symbolic resonance; alternately the heartland is already dotted with Algonquian place names. Education is important; all children should be inducted into their local tribe, made to go through painful initiation rituals, and so on. Most of them don’t require any blood quantum. Longhouse summer camps. Probably a majority of Americans already vaguely believe in the Great Spirit. It can be done.</p><p>Where does that leave Europe? The argument that Europe itself is a 1,500 year old American invention is a bit fiddlier, but it does holds together. It hinges on the Yeniseian languages, which are currently spoken by about a thousand people in three miserable villages along a river in Krasnoyarsk Krai, deep in the middle of Russia. (The largest of those villages is called Kellog. As far as I can tell, there’s no connection to the cornflakes.) These are particularly interesting to linguists, because as far as we can tell the closest relatives of Yeniseian are not among other Siberian languages, but the Na-Dené languages of north America. These include the Athabaskan group spoken across Alaska and Yukon, but also Tlingit on the Northwest Coast and Navajo and Apache in Arizona and New Mexico. For a while the assumption was that Yeniseian was another branch of the language spoken by one of the groups of Siberians to have crossed the Bering Strait and populated the Americas, but that seems not to be the case. In 2014, a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091722">computational phylogenetic analysis</a> by Sicoli and Holton found that Yeniseian did not branch off before other languages in the family, but belongs to a clade <em>within </em>Na-Dené. In other words, the Yeniseians were back-migrants: Americans who, thousands of years later, crossed the Bering Strait in the other direction and returned to Asia.</p><p>In the third century BC, a new people appeared on the borders of China. The Chinese were not unfamiliar with steppe peoples; they’d fought and traded with the Yuezhi, the Altaic and Iranian horse-nomads, for centuries. Confucian tradition assumed that the Yuezhi were basically made of the same stuff as ordinary people; one day, they would inevitably become civilised, obey the Son of Heaven, and adopt Chinese customs. This new people were different. They could not be cooked. The Chinese called them the Xiongnu, and Sima Qian writes that ‘they know nothing of ritual or righteousness… this is their Heaven-endowed nature.’ Something like invaders from another planet: unutterably strange, and warlike in a way China had never experienced. It was Xiongnu raids that spurred the construction of the Great Wall. They lived under a form of government that had never been seen before anywhere in the Old World: the multiethnic tribal confederation. But there must have been one particular tribe at the heart of their pact, because there was a distinct Xiongnu language. Scholars are divided on exactly what this language was. Some assume it was Turkic, because there were a lot of Turkic tribes around at the time. Some conclude it was some kind of proto-Mongolian, because later Chinese wrote that the Mongols were the same as the Xiongnu. But a few linguists, like Edwin Pulleyblank and Alexander Vovin, have tried to study the few scraps of Xiongnu that are actually available, in rough Chinese transliteration. What they find is that Xiongnu bears a marked similarity to Yeniseian. </p><p>In 129 BC, the Xiongnu were finally broken against a massive mounted Han army. The survivors fled into the interior of Asia. Some of them stayed and became tributaries of Emperor Xuan. Others, the more warlike ones, started moving west. Their migration sent ripples through the world. Other steppe peoples either joined the confederation, or started fleeing ahead of their advance, attacking whatever weaker tribes lay to their west. The Xiongnu attacked the Turks, the Turks slammed into the Scythians, the Sycthians pressed into the Germans, and the Germans fled across the borders of a soft and over-ripe Roman Empire. Finally, the people who had <a href="https://phys.org/news/2025-06-european-huns-ancient-siberian-roots.html">once been known as the Xiongnu</a> arrived. In 440 AD, a native American brave named Attila the Hun crossed the Danube and made war against Rome. </p><p>This was the origin of Europe. In a Roman context, Europe is just a landmass. The world is divided into citizens and noncitizens; Roman citizens in Britain and Syria have far more in common with each other than they do with their Pictish or Arab relatives just across the border. A distinctive concept of Europe, a specifically European mode of social organisation, could only emerge out of the ruins of the Empire, once the Americans had torn it open. The distinctly European form of government that emerged in the Dark Ages is the one that most of Europe still lives under today. Europe is not about nations and peoples, knights and maidens, art and culture, knowledge and power, or freedom and democracy. Its history is the history of a <em>sexually perverted supranational bureaucracy</em>.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Sexually perverted bureaucracies are not really uncommon. Here I’m using ‘perversion’ in the proper, neutral, Freudian sense, in which perversion is any deviation from reproductive heterosexuality. (Freud says that the kiss is a perversion, since ‘the parts of the body involved do not form part of the sexual apparatus but constitute the entrance to the digestive tract.’) But traditionally, bureaucratic structures have been more sexually perverse than the societies they govern. The most common form of perversion is celibacy, which is sometimes enforced through castration, as in the eunuch-bureaucracies of dynastic Egypt and imperial China. But there have also been bureaucracies of homosexuals, pederasts, thigh-fuckers, transvestites, people only capable of getting off on various forms of humiliation and spite. Aztec officials dressed in the flayed skins of naked female sacrifice-victims. Everyone’s got their own thing, but you need to have <em>something</em>. An effective administration can’t have hereditary appointments; its ranking and sorting mechanisms must be endogenous, not outsourced to any crude biogenetic system; it must not breed.</p><p>What makes Europe unique in world history is that while the sexually perverted bureaucracy is usually firmly integrated into an imperial state, in Europe the bureaucracy is <em>international</em>. There’s a separation of powers between multiple sovereign authorities, which rule, and a single bureaucracy, which administers. This is not because of any intellectual or cultural heritage, the <em>belief</em> in limited government, but pure historical accident. It was not always the case. After the Edict of Thessalonica in 380, many Roman jurists could imagine, like Fukuyama, that they had reached the end of history. Through all the wars and chaos of the past, God had been slowly driving humanity towards the perfect form of government: the union of one universal Roman Empire and one universal ecumenical church. In the eastern half of the Empire, this union actually managed to hold up. The imperial state and its clerical bureaucracy remained integrated until the Roman Empire finally collapsed with its last two successor states, the Tsardom of Russia and the Ottoman Caliphate, from 1917 to 1924. In the West, meanwhile, imperial authority functionally ended in 476, and the sexually perverted bureaucracy was left alone, without any state scaffolding. </p><p>The post-Roman Church was essentially a cobbled-together assortment of leftover instruments and institutions from the wreck of empire. Diocletian had reorganised the Empire into dioceses, from the Greek <em>dioikisis</em>, meaning <em>housekeeping </em>or <em>administration</em>. Those dioceses no longer responded to the Emperor, but the Church continued to use them to organise its activities, with seated bishops adopting some of the roles of provincial governors. While most of Europe was now governed by the barbarian law codes of the Germans, based around vengeance, feud, and wergild, the Church continued to govern itself through the <em>ius civile</em>, as adapted into canon law. Initially the barbarian states and the bureaucracy were, more or less, at war. The Vandals, Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Burgundians, Langobards, and Suebi all initially followed the Arian heresy. This is usually described as a piece of minor Christological pedantry: the Arians believed Jesus was first among created beings, ontologically dependent on the Father rather than coeternal with him. But there’s a lot at stake here. The Arian God is a healthy, genital, reproductive deity; he fucks and has children. Meanwhile the Nicene God has a non-paternal relation to his own son; he’s mystical and perverse. For Arians, clerical celibacy makes no sense. If producing a son is good enough for God, it’s good enough for you. Arian priests could marry and have heirs; the clergy formed part of the hereditary barbarian warband, which precluded any administrative function. To keep their cocks intact, it was necessary to root out all perversions. Gregory of Tours tells a story from the persecutions of Thrasamund, king of the Vandals and the Alans. Thrasamund tries to forcibly re-baptise a nun from the Roman senatorial class into Arianism, which would, by implication, make her available for sex and marriage-alliance. ‘She was being forcibly immersed in that filthy bath and was crying loudly, ‘I believe that the Father and the Holy Spirit are of one substance with the Son,’ when she stained the water with a worthy ointment, that is, she defiled it with excrement.’ Like all good Catholics, the nun has to insist on the primacy of the anal, the faecal, and the perverse; for shitting the baptismal pool, Thrasamund has her beheaded. This particular story is almost certainly false, but its libidinal content is real, and the persecutions were too. The Arian kings knew that they had to destroy this bureaucracy or else it would swallow their puny warband aristocracies whole, which is exactly what it did.</p><p>States with a functioning civil service tend to do better than states without one, and the Church was a ready-made civil service for any barbarian warlord who wanted to buy in. In 587 AD King Reccared of the Visigoths embraced the Church of Rome and immediately set about slaughtering his Arian subjects. In 603 King Agililf of the Lombards followed suit. The Suebi adopted Catholicism under either Theodemar (if you believe Isidore of Seville) or Chararic (if you believe Gregory of Tours). Soon, throughout what had been the Western Empire, the bureaucracy was administering justice, guaranteeing contracts, recording transactions, maintaining archives, maintaining peace between the territorial powers, conferring legitimacy on their rulers, and, sometimes, withdrawing it. Meanwhile, in the East, where the Empire survived, the Bishop of Rome was just one of the five Pentarchs, along with the bishops of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. For centuries, any new Pope had to be approved by the Byzantine emperor, even though their territorial jurisdictions only vaguely overlapped. The situation did not make any particular sense, and in 800 AD, Pope Leo III saw an opportunity to rebuild the pre-European unity of sovereign and bureaucratic power on the bureaucracy’s terms. A barbarian warlord called Karlus had succeeded in conquering a decent enough chunk of the old empire; Leo decided to invite him to Rome, put a crown on his head, and name him <em>Imperator Romanorum</em>. This did not turn out to be such a great idea. For most of the rest of the mediaeval era, Pope and Emperor were at war.</p><p>Europe is what happens when sovereign and administrative power are disaggregated, but for most of European history both sides have been trying to <em>put them back together</em>. There are two ways of doing this. The bureaucracy wants to seize territorial power from the barbarian kingdoms and rule in its own right; the barbarian kingdoms want to subdue the bureaucracy and bring it under territorial control. You could call these two opposing forces the <em>Guelph</em> and the <em>Ghibelline</em>. In northern Italy in the thirteenth and fourteenth century, Guelphs were mostly burghers, who supported the Pope against the Holy Roman Emperor because their class interests aligned with the system of international governance; Ghibellines were mostly drawn from the aristocracy and peasantry, who supported the Holy Roman Emperor against the Pope as part of their general attachment to particular and parochial forms of government. They fought each other for over two hundred years, and the ferocity of the wars had a lot to do with the fractal network of local resentments it plugged into. Florence was controlled by the Guelphs, so its rivals in Siena declared for the Ghibellines; Pisa was Ghibelline so Lucca went Guelph. Within a city, noble families would frequently switch sides to undercut their rivals or access Papal or Imperial patronage. Every so often, a city’s exiled factionalists would raise a mercenary army, go back home, seize the city, and kill everyone inside. A few years later, the opposite side would do it back to them. </p><p>No one really won. In 1334, the Papacy officially forbade any further use of the terms <em>Guelph</em> or <em>Ghibelline</em>, and anyone who kept up the rivalry was subject to excommunication. After this point, the factions dissolve and the names vanish from history. But the rivalry did not end. The Guelph-Ghibelline distinction is the secret axis of all European politics, into the present day. The precise nature of the sexually perverted supranational bureaucracy has changed a little since the fourteenth century, but not really all that much. Unlike the Church, the European Union does not supply an internal civil service for its member states. (It <em>does</em> for some non-member states, such as Kosovo.) It does not directly provide welfare and administration for the population, or directly collect taxes from them. There are some new powers: the European Central Bank issues currency and sets monetary policy for most of the continent; the Church could not. But the core functions—administering justice, guaranteeing contracts, recording transactions, maintaining archives, maintaining peace between the territorial powers, conferring legitimacy on their rulers, and, sometimes, withdrawing it—are the same. Both institutions also try to nudge the barbarian states towards a common European foreign policy; both claim to elevate humanity above its baser instincts. Most significantly, the classes that support or oppose the bureaucracy have remained basically unchanged. Mercantile interests are still solidly Guelph; the resentful peasants and their landowners both tend Ghibelline. Keir Starmer is a Guelph; Nigel Farage is a Ghibelline. Emmanuel Macron is a Guelph; Marine Le Pen is a Ghibelline. Donald Tusk is a Guelph; Vladimir Putin is a Ghibelline. Georgia Meloni, like any good Italian, switched sides. The split is not just <em>between</em> ideologies. Last decade, the British Conservative Party had a Guelph-Ghibelline civil war that cut across all its usual factional divides. Trotsky might have been a Guelph, but Stalinism was very explicitly Ghibelline.</p><p>What keeps the opposition going is that both positions appear to be impossible. Every victory by either side is always temporary; they always seem to reproduce the same basic situation. What we call the Protestant Reformation was essentially a Ghibelline coup. Lutheran theology is a set of instructions, legible in terms of the bureaucracy’s Christological coding, for the nationalisation of the civil service. One thousand years after the barbarian kings bought into the supranational network, their heirs started dropping out of it. All the new national churches immediately started instituting clerical marriage. Subject the machine to the principles of the barbarian state. In the Thirty Years War both Pope and Emperor were aligned against the hyper-Ghibelline Protestant princes, and lost. The result was the rise of Westphalian sovereignty, in which a local bureaucracy is entirely subordinated to a territorial barbarian state. The State Department seems to think that this is a fundamental aspect of the Western tradition stretching back to Aristotle; it’s not. It’s a minor artefact thrown up by a temporary weakness in the supranational bureaucracy, and it didn’t even last two centuries before the French revolutionaries started once again organising all of Europe through a single, rational, universal, perverted administration. When the barbarian powers of Europe finally crushed the Napoleonic empire, they immediately replaced it with their own supranational institution, the Concert of Europe. In the twenty-first century, the bureaucracy has produced new and virulent forms of Ghibellinism, but already the various barbarians involved are talking about a <em>nationalist international</em>. First those banana-straightening freaks in Brussels must be overthrown, but once it’s done we’ll obviously need a new set of intergovernmental institutions to manage things…</p><p>Europe is <em>cracked open</em>; there’s a constitutive wound running through the whole continent. Instead of forming a unity, political power operates in multiple contradictory registers, all trying to wipe the others out. The interaction zone between territory and bureaucracy constantly scabs into new ideological forms. The name we’ve given this gash is <em>politics</em>. Europe is the political continent; nowhere else in the world produces politics in the same way. China did, once, but only during the Europe-like conditions of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States eras, when power was split between the formal Zhou dynasty and the various squabbling kings. By the Han period the imperial-bureaucratic nexus had been re-established. The Hundred Schools of Thought, with their various egoist or communist or altruist utopias, melted away. Legalism was neutered and absorbed into Confucian doctrine; no other ideologies were left. (The royal fashion for Buddhism did briefly introduce some tension between the sovereign and the scholars. When Emperor Xianzong planned to exhibit a holy relic, the finger-bone of the Buddha, Han Yu wrote an objection: ‘This Buddha was a barbarian, who did not speak the language of China and wore clothes of a different fashion. If he were still alive and came to our court, Your Majesty might condescend to receive him, but he would then be escorted to the borders of the state and dismissed. How then, when he is dead, could his rotten bones, the foul and unlucky remains of his body, be admitted to the palace? Your servant is deeply shamed and begs that this bone be given to the proper authorities to be cast into fire and water, that this evil may be rooted out.’ But the tension only lasted a while; eventually Buddhism was also dissolved into the bureaucratic state.) When Chinese peasants periodically rose up and overthrew the ruling dynasty, lacking any alternative models, they simply instituted a new dynasty. In India, where bureaucratic Brahmins and sovereign Kshatriyas were gelled together through an omnipresent and fractal caste system, opposition took the form of individual spiritual transcendence. Even in the Islamic world, everything stabilises around the divinely-appointed caliph; the various political factions mostly just disagree on the exact line and programme of succession.</p><p>America is also a deeply apolitical continent. There, the autochthonous procedural liberalism absorbs everything, in the same way that Confucianism did in China. America lacks a wound; the fundamental structure of power is never in question. In its two hundred and fifty year-long history, the United States has not produced a single political ideology. Everything has to be continually imported from Europe. First the Roman civic dribble, then communism and anarchism, then Social Catholicism, then Austrian school psychotism, then warmed-over ordoliberalism repackaged as the Third Way; now, Republican Party staffers are tittering in the mirror while they try on bits of the French Nouvelle Droite. But because America is fundamentally savage, all these ideologies lose their political character as soon as they cross the Atlantic. It all gets processed into culture war, hairstyles and sex. America is a visual, symbolic culture; everything ends up resolving into some kind of conspicuous consumption. But Europe is political. We churn this stuff out ceaselessly. Yes, we invented the doctrine of individual liberty and natural rights—not because these are particularly integral to the European project, but because we invented <em>everything</em>. The most utterly dehumanising and tyrannical ideologies in human history were our doing too. We are not, and have never been, a <em>civilisation</em>. Europe is the point where the surface of the Earth breaks and lava flows out.</p><p>Which leads us back to the US State Department and its crappy essay. The Americans have collected a few little European trinkets, bits of cracked pottery that have washed up on their alien shores, and decided that this is the fundamental essence of our shared heritage. When the actual Europe doesn’t resemble their cargo-cult version, they start militating against ‘a Europe that replaces its spiritual and cultural roots, that treats traditional values as dangerous relics, and that centralises power in unaccountable institutions.’ But constant ideological churn and overweening central bureaucracy aren’t a betrayal of Europe; they <em>are</em> Europe. Once again, the savage Americans are at our gates, on the banks of the Danube, with their iron weapons raised against a society they will never understand, but want to destroy anyway. One of the wrongest ideas now current on the American right is that we’re witnessing a ‘return of the strong gods,’ all the old passions and loyalties that the postwar managerial order tried to contain. Tribe and nation, kith and kin. Sorry, but my gods are stronger than your gods. The forces of cosmopolitanism and internationalism are deeply rooted in the soil of this continent; they are ancient and wild. You can try to fight them, splinter the continent into another patchwork of barbarian kingdoms; this is what the State Department’s screed is really all about. But please do it without all this neurotic civilisational dogshit. At least when Attila attacked us, he didn’t pretend he was trying to ‘preserve the goods of our common culture.’ </p><p>Europe does have a natural ally, but it’s not the United States. The only other part of the world to have produced a genuine politics is China. Things went quiet on that front for around two thousand years, but in the twentieth century China started producing politics again: if anything, too much politics. (Well, we did too.) The Cultural Revolution was a war of extermination fought by Mao as a Legalist Huangdi against the Communist Party as Confucian bureaucracy. The bureaucracy appears to have closed over that wound, but don’t be surprised if strange politics start leaking out from beneath the skin. Our societies are becoming more and more compatible. This union is, of course, the American nightmare; ever since 1945, American geopolitical policy has tried to prevent any power from integrating the entire Eurasian landmass, which would reduce America to, as Henry Kissinger once warned, an ‘island off the coast of the world.’ But the current administration is apparently no longer interested in ruling the world: it’s simultaneously antagonising China and writing mean-spirited little Substack essays trashing the political legacy of Europe. The time for a new Sino-European century is now. We will offer incense before statues of Robert Schuman and Joseph Bech. We will sing <em>The West is Blue</em>. In our Belgian fetish clubs, our English dogging spots, and the saunas of Shenzhen, we will become more perverted than you can possibly imagine.</p>

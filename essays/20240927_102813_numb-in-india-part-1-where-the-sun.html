Buzzing, bustling, hectic, frenetic, chaotic, overwhelming. It’s not: in fact, this might be the calmest, most sedate place I’ve ever visited in my life. On the streets, a near-total stillness reigns. Every square foot is packed with tuktuks, rickshaws, motorbikes, the odd three-wheeled van, sometimes wooden carts strapped to old, bony ponies or static cud-chewing cows. Nobody is going anywhere. The vehicles tangle together at every unmarked intersection. They move inches at a time, honking contentedly at each other like a herd of grazing geese. If you absolutely have to get somewhere, the only way is on foot. A few porters weave their way through the logjam, heaving huge bales of copper rods or PVC pipes, or sacks of unidentifiable material balanced on their heads. On the fringes of the street, people cluster around stalls selling chai or chaat, haggling, gossiping, bickering, but mostly just saying the word <em>hai</em> to each other. A street is not something you move through to get somewhere else; you’re already here. The main activity is <em>timepass</em>, the act of simply floating in the great static sea of it all, watching nothing as it happens before your eyes. </p><p>Everything does timepass here. The day-labourers, the chaiwallas, the stallholders. People with little businesses selling nuts and bolts in every size, or rubber tubes, or doorknobs. There’s a street where every shop sells galvanised steel springs. One for fire extinguishers. One for industrial hooks. But the old city is so clotted with itself that no one who needs a galvanised steel spring can get anywhere close, so the trader sits in his meticulously clean office tiled in Italian marble and does timepass. Animals most of all. Fat, diseased monkeys sit in the nests of electric cabling that hang between each building and do nothing. Thousands of stray dogs lie on the pavement with their chins to the concrete, sad-eyed, passive. Across the railway tracks in Paharganj, feral cattle stand stock-still in the middle of the road, totally indifferent to the vehicles grunting and beeping around them. In Daryaganj I witnessed a huge, mangy rat waddling unhurriedly along the side of the road. A barefoot child was throwing pebbles at it, but it still couldn’t even be bothered to scurry. The only ones in a hurry to get anywhere here are the Western tourists. They fuss about, trying to weave through the crowds and the traffic, trying to get to the Red Fort, the spice market, the Jama Masjid, and when nothing moves out of their way they say Delhi is bustling and hectic and overwhelming. They don’t look where they’re going. They step in small piles of shit.</p><p>Like most things that call themselves old, Old Delhi is actually the second newest. Its real name is Shahjahanabad, after the Mughal Emperor who built this place as his capital in 1648. Early European visitors marvelled at the Peacock Throne, the gardens, the magnificent boulevard of Chandni Chowk lined with palaces, the glorious capital of an empire that ruled over one hundred million people. But Shahjahanabad was not the first Delhi: according to tradition, the first was the city of Indraprastha, founded by the Pandavas around 3000 BC. According to the <em>Mahabharata</em>, Indraprastha was built by the demon-architect Mayasura: the city had wide streets and fruit trees, and at the centre was a palace of illusions, with crystal floors that looked like lotus ponds and pools so still they looked like solid stone, invisible doors, ceilings disguised as clouds. The city was so beautiful that the Pandavas’ cousins tried to claim it for themselves, sparking the apocalyptic Kurukshetra War that sunk the universe into Kali Yuga, the lowest of the four world-ages, which we’re still in today. Every so often the Indian government announce that they’re about to uncover the ruins of Indraprastha under their feet, the last fragments of a better world, but so far nobody’s found any shards of magic crystal in the five-thousand-year stratum beneath Delhi, just some very plain pottery. </p><p>There were seven other Delhis that did leave physical remnants. The thousand-year-old ruins of Lal Kot, including the Iron Pillar of Delhi, are in the suburbs to the south. The crumbling walls of Siri, built by the Delhi Sultanate, now contain a big sports complex used for the Asian Games in 1982 and the Commonwealth Games in 2010. The massive stone towers of Tughlaqabad rise above a freeway on the edge of the modern city, containing nothing. Tughluq was a cruel and fanatical warlord who came out of the wordless steppes of central Asia to usurp the throne of Delhi; he died when a beautiful pavilion built to celebrate his victories collapsed on his head. His son Mohammed was known as the Mad Sultan; he built the city of Jahanpanah, meticulously planning every detail until it was the most harmonious city in the world, and then moved his capital thousands of miles away on a whim. There’s nothing left of Jahanpanah; its site is now a swathe of wealthy suburbs. Gracefully curving American-style streets, immaculate lawns, coffee shops with lots of tasteful polished concrete, cocktail bars. Mohammed was succeeded by his cousin Firuz, who oversaw the empire’s decline and dismemberment; the wreck of his city of Firuzbad is near the Gandhi Museum, and supposedly inhabited by djinn. In 1526, the Mughals came pouring out of Afghanistan to smash open the carapace of the Tughluqid Sultanate. The second Mughal Emperor, Humayun, built a city called Dinpanah, some of which is still intact: the empty palaces are now set near the baboon enclosure in the Delhi Zoo. Shah Jahan was Humayun’s great-grandson. His city has been repeatedly sacked: by the Iranians, by the Marathas, by the Afghans, by the Jats, and by the Sikhs. Despite that, it’s still inhabited today. </p><p>For now, at least. Because India has an ecumenical attitude to time, it’s also possible to name the four cities of Delhi that haven’t been built yet. Raashtradhoop, which will flatten the Old City and almost everything around it in the middle of this century, will be a vast, flat landscape of modular housing units, set in a perfect and legible grid, with security checkpoints every four blocks and drones permanently buzzing overhead, flown in partnership with the Tata-Amazon Hypercorporation. In 2829 the government will flee across the river to the new city of Shashvatapuspani, where the High Samiti of Neo-Hindustan will play strange games with shapes we can’t currently imagine. Six-dimensional neighbourhoods, folding over and under themselves through zones of space that absolutely exist, just not in our universe. After the nuclear destruction of Shashvatapuspani unleashes self-replicating negageometries across the Gangetic plain, the region will be uninhabited for tens of thousands of years, but in 33064 AD the city of Teu Agu will be founded on the site of what was once Delhi. The bloodkings of Teu Agu will collect their transfusions from the masses shivering in irradiated slums, and with generations and biograft they will slowly, over the millennia, become something other than human, something slowly returning to the inorganic. Their bodies will glow with a pure white light. Eventually they will no longer have any need for skin. They will become larger and diffuse, until the blinding sandstorm of their outer regions swirl over a square kilometre or more. The final city of Delhi will have no name. A harvest zone, crammed with billions of human beings waiting for the holy wind to consume their bodies and incorporate their minds. This final city of dung bricks and reed huts will be destroyed in the year 428,887 AD, and when the wind that used to be the bloodkings of Teu Agu finally ends the age of Kali will end with it. Dharma will return to the world, and we will enter Satya Yuga again.</p><p>All of this is pretty much set in stone. The Delhi that troubles me is the other one, the one in between. If I go south of Shahjahanabad, something strange happens. The crowded alleyways widen out into long, tree-lined avenues and straighten into right angles. Suddenly I’m surrounded by buildings with white classical columns and high gothic domes. There’s a big triumphal arch. I might have spent eight hours on a plane from London, but it all feels weirdly familiar. According to the signs, this place is called New Delhi. And there’s something else weird: I’m here in the great Ganges basin, seat of an ancient civilisation to rival anything in Europe, but I understand all the signs perfectly, because they’re all in the familiar speech of the Angles and Saxons and Jutes. Could it be that I’m not the first Englishman to set foot in this place?</p><p>For the next few months, Numb at the Lodge will be on a brain-melting tourist odyssey across the past and future of Indias real and imagined. The more prosaic way of putting this is that I, a white British person, will be looking at and writing about India, and this is the type of situation that sometimes invokes phrases like <em>colonial gaze</em>. In 1942, the Indian National Congress issued a demand: ‘To every Britisher: quit India at once. You are an unwanted foreigner, a usurper, and an outlaw in this country.’ This is not ambiguous. But here I am. No point skirting around it. Let’s talk about the Empire.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f1727eb-9155-428b-abd2-40ae9bdcb8e5_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f1727eb-9155-428b-abd2-40ae9bdcb8e5_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f1727eb-9155-428b-abd2-40ae9bdcb8e5_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f1727eb-9155-428b-abd2-40ae9bdcb8e5_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f1727eb-9155-428b-abd2-40ae9bdcb8e5_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f1727eb-9155-428b-abd2-40ae9bdcb8e5_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4f1727eb-9155-428b-abd2-40ae9bdcb8e5_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3250358,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f1727eb-9155-428b-abd2-40ae9bdcb8e5_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f1727eb-9155-428b-abd2-40ae9bdcb8e5_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f1727eb-9155-428b-abd2-40ae9bdcb8e5_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f1727eb-9155-428b-abd2-40ae9bdcb8e5_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In September 1803, the forces of the British East India Company defeated a Maratha army and entered Shahjahanabad. The Hindu Maratha Confederacy had spent most of the last century as the biggest power in northern India, but officially they were, like most of the other states they conquered, still vassals of the Mughal Emperor. When the EIC occupied Delhi, they maintained the fiction. The mighty Shahenshah, Protector of the Universe, Sword of Allah, blood of Timur and Genghis Khan, had simply contracted out this British firm to help him manage his realm, collect his taxes, and maintain order among his subjects. The Company paraded around the blind, feeble Shah Alam II in a tattered palanquin and play-acted obeisance to him. Meanwhile, Company men moved into houses in Shahjahanabad, started wearing silks and turbans, took Indian wives. They adopted small pieces of the Persianate culture of the last wave of invaders from the west. The history of white boys saying inshallah runs very deep.</p><p>Then, on the 10th of May, 1857, thousands of the Conpany’s Indian footsoldiers revolted at the cantonment in Meerut, just north of Delhi. The next day, the insurrectionaries were in Shahjahanabad, where they declared the 76-year-old puppet Mughal Bahadur Shah Zafar their leader and the true Emperor, and immediately started executing every British official or merchant they could get their hands on. Uprisings were breaking out across the subcontinent; it took a month before a British army under George Anson arrived to besiege the city. When it did, Anson immediately died of cholera. Command passed to Sir Henry Barnard, who decided to keep up the tradition by fighting a few skirmishes and then immediately dying of cholera too. The siege was inherited by Charles Reid, who wasted no time in catching cholera himself. But after a few months of this, eventually the guns arrived and the walls of Delhi were bombarded for days on end. Sappers blew up the seventeenth-century gates, and once the city was taken Bahadur Shah Zafar was stripped of his fake imperial title and exiled to Burma. Unknown thousands of ordinary people were killed. </p><p>Despite retaking it, the British never really returned to Shahjahanabad. Instead, they started building grids of bungalows outside its ruined walls. Civil Lines: the white town. The name isn’t entirely accurate: wealthy Indians were welcome to live in the white town, but their native dress was banned: they had to wear a suit and tie, like proper people. No more sensuous Orientalism. No more half-caste children. A clean, hygienic space for sober, hardworking administrators. Meanwhile, the glorious capital of Shahjahanabad became the black town, the festering place, ramshackle and lawless. When the centre of the Raj was moved here from Calcutta in 1911, Sir Edwin Lutyens built his monumental Romano-Saracen New Delhi on the outlying fields, and surrounded it with more pleasant streets and more sprawling bungalows. But Old Delhi remained, intractable, like a piece of grit in the brain, the colonial unconscious, seething with everything repressed. </p><p>In 1942, the American Red Cross published a guide to Delhi. It included a map, showing all the wide boulevards and handsome hotels of New Delhi and the Civil Lines. The area that had once been Shahjahanabad was a single grey blob, marked ‘OUT OF BOUNDS.’</p><p>It’s not like that any more. Or, at least, while Westerners still see the Old City as a zone of pure, undiluted Indianness, they’re once again trying to get in. One of my favourite things I read before coming here was a long complaint by a Delhian online, wondering why Westerners keep coming to the worst, dirtiest, most crime-ridden part of his city and then complaining about it. Well, why do we insist on walking around in the filthy streets? Why do we stay in grotty dive hotels in the old town when there’s a Hilton and a Sheraton and a Hyatt near the airport if you’re poor? Why do we say that Delhi is loud and filthy and full of skinny feral cows eating from the piles of garbage in the street, when we’re the ones who can’t seem to resist the allure of Garbagetown? We should go to the nice places instead. ‘Just get 3, 4, 5 Star hotel. In South Delhi, roam, drive, shop in Central and South Delhi. That's it. Watch movies in IMAX. Shop at Big Malls. Eat at Good Restaurants. What more does anybody want?’ As I discovered, a lot of people here seem to have the same attitude. It must be frustrating to be implicitly told that your country is most <em>itself</em> in the places that are poor, cramped, and dangerous. It’s not so <em>authentic</em> for Indians to live well. If you ask a tuktuk driver to take you somewhere in the Old City, there’s a very good chance he’ll approach this as more of an opening move in a negotiation, and start making counter-offers. No, you don’t want to go there. A very bad place, a very scoundrel place. What do you want there? Shopping? Listen, you are a guest in my country, I know a better place for you. I’ll take you, no problem. Sightseeing? Much nicer sights in New Delhi. Meeting a friend? No, not a good idea; I have a better friend, you should meet him instead. By the time you’ve managed to voice some polite objections you’re already speeding towards a luxury mall in the suburbs.</p><p>Still, not everyone is so keen to disavow the Old City. On the eastern edge of Shahjahanabad is the Red Fort, the traditional seat of Mughal rule. On August 15th, 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru was supposed to be celebrating Indian independence by participating in a parade down Lutyen’s Kingsway in New Delhi; instead, he came to the Red Fort, took down the British flag, raised the Indian tricolour, and gave a speech from the ramparts. Every year on Independence Day, the Prime Minister of India raises the flag here and makes a speech. Inside, the Red Fort is a weird hodgepodge of intricately decorated Islamic pavilions and very plain British barracks. The Mughal palaces are open to the winds and cooled by a network of canals running across the marble floors. The British buildings look like they might belong to a boys’ school in Wandsworth. They’ve been converted into museums. Not, as I expected, museums about the history of the Red Fort itself, but museums of the cruelty of the British and the heroic liberation struggle that culminated in a free India. In one, there’s a big nineteenth-century cannon, and a fairly gory mural explaining how they were used. ‘Tying Indians to the mouth of a cannon gun and blowing them to death was a revengeful entertainment for the Englishmen.’ My girlfriend and I kept being approached by Indian visitors who wanted to take a selfie with us. They stood in front of the mouth of the cannon and grinned.</p><p>The account of British rule and independence these museums put forward is a straightforwardly nationalist one. In other words, while not everything they say is factually untrue, it’s all set in a matrix of ideological bullshit. The line is that India is and always has been singular and indivisible. However, from the fourteenth century onward, European nations began to ‘rule, dominate, subjugate, exploit, oppress, loot and plunder’ the rest of the planet. ‘Based on racist principle they propagated that it was White Man’s Burden to civilise the rest of the world.’ But from the day the East India Company set up its first trading posts, every single sector of Indian society, regardless of language, caste, or creed, has been united in its determination to get rid of the foreigners in the name of the eternal Indian nation. There might have been few scattered traitors, princelings and merchants who got rich off British rule, but for everyone else there was only continual resistance. Unfortunately, this truth has been suppressed by British historians. ‘This, they did in order to hide the atrocities and exploitation under the British rule and to suppress the nationalism and nationalist feelings of the people of India.’ The phrase ‘all-India’ comes up a lot. </p><p>This is what Perry Anderson has called the ‘Indian Ideology.’ An eternal, mystical nation that just so happens to coincide with the precise borders of the British Raj. (In 1962, India fought a war with China over the uninhabited wasteland of Aksai Chin, which had been a sacred and inalienable part of the eternal Indian homeland ever since Britain seized it from Tibet in 1914, and which was so close to the hearts of all Indians that China built a road through it without anyone in New Delhi noticing for several years.) The Indian Ideology was a powerful nationalism, but it’s fading now, and the museums at the Red Fort are mostly just a relic. The dominant mode of deranged Indian nationalism is an explicitly Hindu one now, and Hindutva doesn’t have any need to  pretend that all of India was one gregarious family before the British came. During the Raj, the RSS had no real engagement with the independence movement: the empire they wanted to overthrow didn’t belong to the British, but Tughluq and Mohammed and Firuz and Humayun and Shah Jahan. Old and New Delhi are <em>both</em> artefacts of the foreign oppressors. When Narendra Modi gives his Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, he isn’t reclaiming a piece of Indian history from Western colonialism. He’s defacing one thousand years of Muslim conquest and domination. Next to that, the ninety years of the British Raj are barely a blip.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc97c6-8248-47e9-bbfb-c6fcc5a800ff_3875x2906.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc97c6-8248-47e9-bbfb-c6fcc5a800ff_3875x2906.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc97c6-8248-47e9-bbfb-c6fcc5a800ff_3875x2906.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc97c6-8248-47e9-bbfb-c6fcc5a800ff_3875x2906.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc97c6-8248-47e9-bbfb-c6fcc5a800ff_3875x2906.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc97c6-8248-47e9-bbfb-c6fcc5a800ff_3875x2906.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9efc97c6-8248-47e9-bbfb-c6fcc5a800ff_3875x2906.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3065866,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc97c6-8248-47e9-bbfb-c6fcc5a800ff_3875x2906.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc97c6-8248-47e9-bbfb-c6fcc5a800ff_3875x2906.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc97c6-8248-47e9-bbfb-c6fcc5a800ff_3875x2906.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc97c6-8248-47e9-bbfb-c6fcc5a800ff_3875x2906.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>These days, the one place that really obsesses over the iniquities of the British Raj is Britain. </p><p>My girlfriend used to be a history teacher; one year, she taught an A-level course on the history of Britain in India. Whenever she mentioned this to people, though, they all said the same thing: they always asked if she’d managed to sneak any critical material into the syllabus. They all assumed that our eighteen-year-olds were being pumped full of some Michael Gove Niall Ferguson indoctrination about how nice we were to build India all those railways for free. Only a few people dare whisper the forbidden truth: that the British Empire was actually bad. But of course her real problem was precisely the opposite. It was hard to get her students to approach the Raj <em>as historians</em>: to consider it as just one of the sometimes enlightened and sometimes deeply brutal empires that have built and plundered in this land for five thousand years, up to and including the modern republics of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. As far as her students were concerned, the Raj was a moral test on themselves as citizens of the former imperial core, and it was a test they were desperate to pass. </p><p>In a certain approach to history, the Raj is a kind of permanent alibi. The caste system, which we’ll probably end up talking about more later, was invented by British. The deeply conservative sexual culture, and all the pathologies it’s generated, is a product of India’s encounter with bourgeois Victorian morality. Tensions between Muslims and Hindus have no history within India; they’re all reducible entirely to colonial strategies of divide and rule. If you Google the phrase ‘zamindar system,’ Google’s friendly AI search assistant will tell you that aristocratic land ownership was introduced by the British, which is straightforwardly untrue.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> But there’s a strong assumption now that what the British did must have been uniquely bad. So pernicious that even now, seventy-seven years after the Union Flag went down over the Red Fort, the colonial dynamic it set up risks encompassing ordinary tourists who haven’t come to tax the salt or establish a monopoly on trade or fire volleys at unarmed protesters, but to take a few photos and pay too much for taxis. </p><p>The British do <em>feel</em> different from the other empires. The Tughluqids and Moghuls came out of a familiar context: tribes from the Iranian plateau had been moving into the Gangetic Plain long before even the first Indo-Europeans arrived.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> But the British may as well have come from another planet. They did not play by the established rules. Britain is (as I’ve been discovering) a very small country. At their peak in the late eighteenth century, the Marathas—their biggest rival for subcontinental domination—governed two and a half million square kilometres of land and maybe a hundred million people. They produced their own cannon, which were often better than anything the Europeans could put in the field, and they had disciplined troops drilled by French officers. They were fabulously rich and fighting on home territory. Even so, the East India Company could brush aside entire empires at will, because Britain had a <em>more complex financial system</em>. All the wealth and power of the Indian states came from the land. They financed their wars by taxing the peasantry, and the same peasantry provided the main body of their fighting forces. Spend too long at war—and they were always at war, as the Mughal Empire slowly rotted from inside—and you start to devastate your own land and undermine the productive basis of your society. This is why the Indian states were increasingly turning to the EIC to fight their wars for them: as a joint-stock company, the EIC could essentially summon huge sums out of nowhere. The peasants who funded the wars of the Indian states ended up impoverished, hungry, maimed, or dead. The investors who funded the Company’s conquests ended up receiving regular dividends at 12.5%.</p><p>It stands to reason that encountering this alien world would have been enormously destructive to India. One of the first versions of this argument was made by none other than Karl Marx, who wrote in his <em>New York Daily Tribune</em> column that ‘the misery inflicted by the British on Hindostan is of an essentially different and infinitely more intensive kind than all Hindostan had to suffer before.’ The other states had only killed, tortured, raped, burned, looted, and destroyed, but because they came from another world the British tore apart the entire foundation of Indian society. For Marx, the basis of the Asiatic mode of production is the village system, which combines agriculture with local industry: ‘that peculiar combination of hand-weaving, hand-spinning and hand-tilling.’ Initial exposure to international markets made India rich: ‘Europe received the admirable textures of Indian labour, sending in return for them her precious metals. Even the lowest class, those who go about nearly naked, had commonly a pair of golden ear-rings and a gold ornament of some kind hung round their necks.’ But once Britain had dominated India, the balance of trade reversed. With a vast, captive market, Britain flooded India with mass-produced textiles from the mills of Manchester, destroying local industries and ensuring that the flow of money went from India to England and not the other way round. In the eighteenth century, the Calico Acts had banned the import of cotton textiles into Britain, protecting British mills from competition with Bengal and creating the conditions for the Industrial Revolution. Without political independence, India could not do the same. For Marx the materialist, the decoupling of agriculture from industry means traumatically cleaving the entire population of India ‘from all its ancient traditions, and from the whole of its past history.’<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a></p><p>You hear this line a lot. (Sometimes more extreme versions. Respectable Indian newspapers talk about an outright ban on Indian textile production that never actually existed; there’s a persistent myth that colonial authorities systematically cut off the thumbs of Bengali weavers.) But it doesn’t seem to be entirely true. Artisan handicrafts did suffer in India when industrial fabrics were introduced, and colonial tariff policy was absolutely designed to favour Manchester. But even if the imperialists <em>tried</em> to destroy Indian industry, that doesn’t mean they succeeded. You don’t have to agree with Tirthankar Roy’s politics, or even his conclusions, to accept his data. After a decline in the nineteenth century, traditional handicrafts started to recover. By 1940, nearly two billion yards of handmade cloth were being produced, far more than during the eighteenth century, supplying 30% of the domestic market. In 1903, nearly a third of India’s industrial workforce were still using hand looms; it remained the country’s biggest form of industrial employment until the late 1980s. Besides handicrafts, though, India developed a mechanised industry of its own. ‘One of the world’s largest cotton textile mill industries emerged in India in the 19th century, in direct competition with Manchester. If the Raj had either the intention or the authority to stop the process it would be hard to explain how Bombay’s merchants could invest in a field where Indians competed—successfully—with the most politically powerful of British industries.’ </p><p>But there were <em>two</em> threads to Marx’s essay: the British destruction of Indian industry and the British neglect of Indian land. ‘There have been in Asia, generally, from immemorial times, but three departments of Government; that of Finance, or the plunder of the interior; that of War, or the plunder of the exterior; and, finally, the department of Public Works… The British in East India accepted from their predecessors the department of finance and of war, but they have neglected entirely that of public works. Hence the deterioration of an agriculture which is not capable of being conducted on the British principle of free competition, of <em>laissez-faire </em>and<em> laissez-aller</em>.’ The land was extremely important. India might have been conquered by the xenotic forces of financialised capitalism, but the British Raj ruled it in exactly the same way as every previous empire. The majority of the Raj’s revenues came from land taxes: squeezing the surplus out of hundreds of millions of impoverished peasants, often using brutal zamindars as intermediaries. In areas under the ryotwari system, where peasants owned their own fields, the assessment was 50% on dry land (ie, mostly wheat crops) and 60% on wet (rice). Meanwhile, the majority of the Raj’s expenditures went on the military. British India was a military state. Its vast manpower was used by Britain for imperial conquests around the world—the British Army, during this period, was essentially an Indian army with some British officers—but the main function of the military was to threaten and occasionally bludgeon the rest of India into compliance. Cantonments in every city, armed stations from the rocky Afghan border to the mouth of the Kra Buri. The entire vast infrastructure depended on the small square rice and wheat fields that still blanket much of the country, but yields under the Raj were low, shockingly low, and at several points actually shrank.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a> British land policy wasn’t quite feudal—by 1931 a third of the agricultural workforce were wage-labourers—but as in feudalism, almost the entire surplus was appropriated for military purposes, with almost no major reinvestment in productivity. This made the vast majority of Indians desperately poor, and their lives incredibly fragile. Despite the major improvements in agriculture in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the rate of famine massively increased during the Raj. Tens of millions died, across the country, often in its most agriculturally productive regions. The last major Indian famine was in 1943; there have been no widespread famines at all since independence. </p><p>In the end, the impression left by the British Raj is one of deep stupidity. The whole colonial experience was stupid, it happened for no very good reason, and it was sustained by people who didn’t have any idea what they were doing or why. It would make a lot more sense if Britain really had massively enriched itself by impoverishing India, but it’s not clear that that’s what really happened. Britain impoverished India, sure, but for no real purpose at all except the nebulous glory and prestige of making South Asia pink on the map. The British held on to India to keep its surpluses and its manpower, which was mostly spent in holding on to India. One vast, deadly, pointless waste.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F150b9328-f224-40c7-bc55-4ec4aff7c1cb_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F150b9328-f224-40c7-bc55-4ec4aff7c1cb_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F150b9328-f224-40c7-bc55-4ec4aff7c1cb_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F150b9328-f224-40c7-bc55-4ec4aff7c1cb_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F150b9328-f224-40c7-bc55-4ec4aff7c1cb_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F150b9328-f224-40c7-bc55-4ec4aff7c1cb_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/150b9328-f224-40c7-bc55-4ec4aff7c1cb_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2320868,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F150b9328-f224-40c7-bc55-4ec4aff7c1cb_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F150b9328-f224-40c7-bc55-4ec4aff7c1cb_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F150b9328-f224-40c7-bc55-4ec4aff7c1cb_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F150b9328-f224-40c7-bc55-4ec4aff7c1cb_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>One thing the Empire did, though, is tie the histories of Britain and India together, possibly forever. I just don’t think the <em>colonial</em> relation is the enduring part of it. India is a big, young, growing country. Britain is small, and slowly shrinking out of history. In the future, I think the entire history of Britain, from the Saxons crossing the sea to Alfred at Ethandun to the Arthurian cycle to Chaucer to Shakespeare to the first stirrings of liberalism and the scientific method to the ships out across new seas and chasing new worlds, the flying shuttle, the dark Satanic mills, the huge industrial cities, the labour movement, the summer of empire, the trenches, the last stand against Hitler in Europe, the electronic computer, the Beatles, the Stones, the Sex Pistols—all of it will ultimately be remembered as a minor episode in the history of India. </p><p>Britain and northern India are the two most distant members of of the Indo-European family: we both have legends of horse-twins deep in our history, we both write epic poetry, we both negate a word by prefixing it with ‘a-,’ we’re basically the same. The future will probably not make the same distinctions we do. Maybe Britain will be remembered as an outlying province of the great subcontinent. Tales of a Raja Guhyakared, who defeated the Great Vidharmi Army and saved Vesaiks from the Uttarpurush. How Viliyam Hilānabhāl composed great natyas at the court of Yakub Khan. Or maybe, if anything of my country survives, it will be in India. Did you know that the English language doesn’t actually come from India, but originally developed on a cold island thousands of miles away? Did you know that the Indian system of parliamentary democracy was actually brought to the country by foreign invaders? Did you know that the sport of cricket was invented by—oh, the Mughals, or the Timurids, something like that. One of those brief dynasties that burst into being for just a moment, all blood and gold and rubies, and then disappear, until all that’s left of them is the marks they carved into the vast broad weatherbeaten body of India, which has remained for thousands of years, and will remain.</p><p></p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>There’s a kind of strangled admission that the Mughals might have had something to do with it, but they insist that before then all Indians lived in village communes.

Maybe the most <em>pleasant</em> place I visited in Old Delhi was the Jama Masjid, pictured above, in which Shah Jahan flaunted his wealth by building an enormous empty plaza dotted with cooling fountains and kept scrupulously clean, in front of his mosque. The caretaker showed us around; he was very proud of the fact that not just Muslims but Hindus and Sikhs come to his masjid just to hang out. I can understand why.</p></div></div>

Just because he makes a faint, gurgling, rattling noise whenever he opens his mouth, the sound of something mucosal squelching around in old lead pipes. Just because he stares like a lobotomy patient. Just because he speaks in a mush of boiled consonants, and at the end of his sentences the words all dribble out together like a newborn baby’s milky-white puke. All he did was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v-8wJkmwBY">stand on a debate stage</a> next to Donald Trump’s shit-eating grin, looking like a corpse still jerked around by the family of mice that’s started burrowing inside. All he did was say things like ‘we finally beat Medicare’ and ‘there’s a lot of young women who are being raped by their sisters, by, just, it’s just ridiculous.’ And now, Thomas Friedman thinks Joe Biden needs to stand down. </p><p>He said so the morning after the debate. ‘The Biden family and political team must gather quickly,’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/joe-biden-tom-friedman.html">he wrote</a>, ‘and have the hardest of conversations with the president, a conversation of love and clarity and resolve. To give America the greatest shot possible of deterring the Trump threat in November, the president has to come forward and declare that he will not be running for re-election.’ Frank Bruni had a similar thought. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/presidential-debate-trump-biden-2024.html">asked</a>: ‘Is it really too late for another Democrat to take Biden’s place? With stakes this high, mustn’t that be discussed one more time before the convention?’ Nicholas Kristof began <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/opinion/joe-biden-drop-out.html">his piece</a> by saying that ‘President Biden is a good man, but I hope he reviews his debate performance Thursday evening and withdraws from the race.’ In fact, they all called Biden a good man. They all said that retiring would be an act of service. The<em> New York Times</em> didn’t publish all these pieces because these writers have different, interesting perspectives that all need to be heard. Certainly not because they have different, interesting literary voices. (If you want language that doesn’t sound deader than Joe himself, it’s all crammed into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/presidential-debate-winner-loser.html">the roundtable</a>. ‘Disastrous.’ ‘God help us.’ ‘He sounded like a dying humidifier.’) The <em>Times</em> paid for the same opinion column three times because they’re trying to simulate unanimity: each column pre-approves the others; together, they all say that this is just what <em>everyone thinks</em>. Finally, the editorial board came out with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/biden-election-debate-trump.html">its own statement</a>. ‘Mr Biden has been an admirable president. But the greatest public service Mr Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election.’ Political animals move in herds. Maybe if a few big dumb buffalo turn away, the rest will follow, instead of blindly stampeding into the black ravine that is Joe Biden’s mind…</p><p>Cowards! Backstabbers! Ingrates! Traitors! Snakes! Biden’s performance at that debate was <em>magnificent</em>. No one is better placed or richlier qualified to lead his county through the rest of this decade. Before the debate I still wasn’t sure, but now I’m absolutely committed; I’m ridin’ with Biden, even if I know exactly where this road leads. Make him president for life! It could be longer than you think. Hook him up to machines, flood his veins with crank. Long live Joe! Long live the king!</p><p>These writers, with all their grave <em>concerns</em>—exactly where do they think they live? I’m sure everyone at the <em>Times</em> would prefer it if they came from a nice sane Western European democracy, but you don’t. This is America, baby! This is the great death-continent, this is a vast cannibal island off the coast of the world. America has never been governed by the living. When the Mexica were in Chapultepec, migrating south, their priest-king asked a local noble called Achitometl for his daughter, to be their sovereign and the bride of the living god. When the girl arrived, she was dressed in feathers and perfumes, garlanded with beautiful flowers. Then the Mexica killed her, flayed her, cut out her heart, and invited Achitometl to watch the priest-king dance while wearing her ragged, splattered skin. That’s what it meant to be a sovereign. Up the in Andes, Tawantinsuyu was ruled by its dead: mummified corpses wearing gold masks, seated at their tables with brown withered hands out flat, still dressed in their fine clothes, still waited on by their servants, still issuing orders. The Sapa Inca is not a ruler for life; his reign lasts much longer than that. No war or marriage without first consulting the dead.</p><p>This is your heritage as an American. So yes, fine: your democratic process has been reduced to an Old Man Contest, two leathery codgers competing over who has more of his brain still functioning. Odds are pretty good that both candidates were wearing some kind of adult incontinence nappy for the debate. A good night for either of them meant not visibly drooling or falling over on stage. So what? This upsets you? You think your country ought to be better than this? Are you really worried about <em>Joe Biden</em>? Joe Biden is still alive! He talks! You can ask him what day of the week it is, and he’ll answer you! The answer might even be <em>accurate</em>! What are you complaining about? For thousands of years, your continent was ruled by the silent mountains and the blood-hungry sun, and they spoke a language only measurable in graves. Next to them, Joe Biden is a model of lucidity. </p><p>What the backstabbers don’t understand is that Joe Biden is president for a reason. You will not unseat him, because he is the man for his age. Napoleon might have been the world-spirit on horseback, but the world-spirit no longer needs horses. Joe Biden is the world-spirit dribbling ice cream down its chin.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>You say he’s too old. Joe Biden will turn eighty-two shortly after the election, and this upsets you. The world is full of people freaking out because they’re about to turn thirty and they still haven’t written a novel or found true love. It’s over: if you haven’t achieved all your life goals while you’re still a blastocyst, it’s over, you never will. The secret content of all this stuff is, of course, that you’re off the hook: having failed, you’re now free to spend the rest of your life drooling in front of various screens. But here’s Joe Biden, in the dim winter of his year, at the point where Philip Larkin’s stark alp of extinction, ‘the peak that stays in view wherever we go,’ is now just gently rising ground. He’s supposed to be up there on its foothills, gratefully looking back over the life he’s almost finished living. Instead, in his closing chapters, he decided to become the most powerful man in the world. He refuses to stop! His wife died, his daughter died, his son died, but Joe Biden just rises like a balloon above the churning of the generations. Now he wants the job again. So you whine that his rigor-mortis grip on the candidacy means handing the election to Donald Trump. The future of the planet is at stake, and we’re all being held hostage to the pissy intransigence of one old man. But you can’t stop him. He is eighty-one years old, his brain has melted into a lukewarm puddle lapping at the bottom of his cranium, but still you can’t stop him.</p><p>Biden is not too old. There’s literally no such thing as too old; it’s logically impossible for anyone to ever be out of touch. For some reason, you believe that every era belongs only to its youth. This is because you’re an idiot. Someone mentions the 1980s and all you can imagine is one of your dinky electropop bands with asymmetrical haircuts. But every age has a ruling cohort as well as a ruling class, and the struggle is almost always a struggle between the ancient and the merely middle-aged. There have been maybe three or four moments of genuine youth revolt in human history; the rest of the time the young just pretend they came up with the last generation’s slogans. In 1917, Lenin was nearly fifty. But the American Revolution was one: James Monroe was eighteen in 1776, Alexander Hamilton was twenty-one, and Thomas Jefferson was practically a pensioner at thirty-three. That was a long time ago. The world is older now.</p><p>Intellectually you know it’s not the case, but the young all secretly believe that old people are really just people of a <em>different type</em>. People can be black or white or male or female, and some people just happen to have skin hanging off them like a physalis’s robe, and swollen hands that twitch, and eyes that look at nothing in particular, and a mouth only muttering, and everything it mutters is banal. You make it about halfway through your life before you really, truly understand that all these people <em>used to be young</em>. Once they were the bold ones, sweaty when they danced. Maybe it’s difficult to square that thought with the creature you see in front of you, but that’s exactly the point. Old people belong to the present, far more than anyone else. They can’t have anything to do with the past, <em>in their capacity as old people</em>, because in the past they were not old. But unlike the young, they’re desperately poor in future: aside from the present, they have nowhere else to go.</p><p>You think the year 2024 is made of whatever its youngest people are doing; skibidi toilet tiktoks and frail little essays about the sadness and yearning of girlhood. But Joan Didion was born in 1934, and until you learn to do something truly different, so were you. The current year is patched together from early bird specials, mushy foods you can eat without your teeth in, bath shoes and peach-pink cardigans, floral prints on sofas, pickleball, minion memes. The stuff of the present is drawn from the furthest wisps of living memory. A bare bulb swinging in a wooden shack, dragging gothic shadows around a bare earthen floor. We are still in the Great Depression. We are gathered around the radio set, listening to race music. All our pop culture is about harvesting corn. In fact, he’s out there right now: Corn Pop, terror of the Delaware marshes, with a straight razor in his hand and lapels so wide old ladies faint on the spot. These are not memories of the past. Larkin was wrong when he said that the old fools are <em>there</em>, but this is <em>here</em>. Those lighted rooms inside their heads are what the world is made of, right now. </p><p>Almost every age is best embodied by almost any old person. But especially now, and especially Joe Biden.</p><p>Biden is confused. He forgets things. Just in the last few months, he confused Mexico with Egypt, France with Germany, Iraq with Ukraine, Emmanuel Macron with François Mitterrand, Angela Merkel with Helmut Kohl, and the All Blacks with the Black and Tans. When Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister, Biden referred to him as ‘Rashid Sanuk,’ unilaterally converting the man to Islam. He couldn’t remember exactly when he was vice president, or when his oldest son died. He has repeatedly forgotten how to communicate in the English language, how to pick up objects with his hands, how to climb stairs with his feet. This person is lost and helpless in a world he fundamentally does not understand. Reality appears as a vast stock of things he’s already forgotten, appearing only as the ghostly outlines of worm-bored lacunae in his brain. </p><p>A few quick questions. You’re not allowed to look anything up. Who is currently Chancellor of Germany? What did you do ten days ago, on the nineteenth of June? How many phone numbers do you know off by heart?</p><p>We are living in an amnesiac age. One of the most interesting and honest statements ever made by any tech guy came from Google’s vice-president Bradley Horowitz back in 2015, when he was <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/bradley-horowitz-says-that-google-photos-is-gmail-for-your-images-and-that-google-plus-is-not-dead-54be1d641526">trying to explain</a> what Google Photos was actually for. ‘We have a proliferation of devices and storage and bandwidth,’ he said, ‘to the point where every single moment of our life can be saved and recorded. But you don’t get a second life with which to curate, review, and appreciate the first life.’ So the software would curate, review, and appreciate your life for you. You keep snapping away, and the app will do the work of turning the chaos of your life into a comprehensible narrative. ‘We make it so there’s no cognitive burden to actually saving everything.’ But what’s it like to be cognitively unburdened? I think it’s indistinguishable from cognitive <em>decline</em>. This is Google’s mission: ‘to automate the process so that users can be in the moment.’ With all your memories safely stored on the machine, and all interpretation performed by algorithm, you just exist in a constant, contextless present. Objects rear into view, suddenly, like monsters out of the mist, and you take photos of them until they disappear again.</p><p>This is not a new complaint. Notoriously, Plato already made it in the <em>Phaedrus</em>, two and a half thousand years ago. Back then, the culprit was <em>writing</em>. ‘If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls. They will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks.’ And he was completely right. I’ve read a lot of books: do I actually <em>know</em> any of the information inside them? Did reading EE Evans-Pritchard’s 1937 ethnological masterwork <em>Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic among the Azande</em> actually teach me anything? It’s not like I went to Sudan to find out what the Azande are up to for myself, like Evans-Pritchard did; I just sat in a chair and let the stream of facts and interpretations dribble over my face. Every reader, if they’re honest, admits that most of what they read is forgotten pretty much instantly. The Azande believe that witches have an extra organ in their body that secretes a witchcraft-substance: I remember that. It’s on the first page. Everything else—well, if I need a particular piece of information, I can probably remember where in the book to find it. A lot of people make notes, but that’s exactly the same thing: you’re offloading your memory onto a notebook. Is knowing the <em>location</em> of the information the same as knowing it? All this is troubling enough when we’re just talking about ordinary writing. But what if the location of the information is on Wikipedia?</p><p>Earlier this year, the literary critic Ann Manov <a href="https://www.bookforum.com/print/3004/lauren-oyler-s-meditations-on-goodreads-anxiety-and-gossip-25333">reviewed a book of essays</a> by the literary critic Lauren Oyler. Her review was broadly considered to have been brutal, a bloodbath, etc. Most of it is just ordinary judgement, but the core of the thing is the passage where Manov works out that all of Oyler’s research has been conducted on Wikipedia:</p><p><em>In her essay on Goodreads, Oyler offers a brief account of the history behind rating books out of five stars, all of which is—you guessed it—available on the Wikipedia page for ‘Star (classification),’ which comes up when you Google ‘history behind rating books out of five stars.’ First, Oyler discusses Regency Englishwoman Mariana Starke’s exclamation-point-filled guidebook to the Continent (and a quote from </em>The Charterhouse of Parma<em> mocking it, conveniently referenced on Ms. Starke’s Wikipedia page). Then, she makes a brief foray into the Michelin star (apparently less ‘whimsical’ than exclamation points). And finally, she visits the </em>Best American Short Stories<em> series and its editor Edward O’Brien’s asterisks indicating ‘permanence.’ Oyler includes extensive quotes from totally forgotten American satirist Oliver Herford’s nearly unreadable review trashing O’Brien’s selections for the 1921 </em>BASS<em> (a review conveniently referenced on the ‘Star (classification)’ Wikipedia page).</em></p><p>But the grubby secret of intellectual production is that <em>everyone does this</em>. When I <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-dust-of-god">wrote about baetyls</a> this spring, I discovered that a bunch of writers—including Shaykh Afifi al-Akiti, Fellow in Islamic Studies at Oxford—had repeated an absolutely false claim about the Kaaba in Mecca that appears to have popped into existence from nowhere on its Wikipedia page. But I do it too. This piece is basically just a bunch of ludicrous takes and off-the-cuff impressions, but writing it still involved reflexively clicking around the Wikipedia pages for ‘Inca Empire,’ ‘Blastocyst,’ ‘Vladimir Lenin,’ ‘Physalis,’ and ‘Anamnesis (philosophy).’ Every trendy young writer is really just stamping their brand on the labour of the solemn, dedicated, anonymous dickless weirdos who actually write the articles on Wikipedia. The proletarians of thought. You don’t know their names, and you’d probably flinch if you saw them in real life, but you’ve decided to let these people replace a significant chunk of your brain. (Actually, the trendy young writers do all contribute to exactly one Wikipedia article: their own.) In a sense, everyone knows everything; we’re all plugged in to the same external memory. In another sense, nobody except the wikimonks has any knowledge of anything at all. At least when all our information came from books, everyone had a slightly different library of things they’d forgotten; now, we’ve all forgotten the same great universal sludge of facts.</p><p>And you think Joe Biden is <em>out of touch</em>? You think someone <em>else</em> should have the job? The sovereign is the mirror of his realm. The Fisher King sits in his wound, placidly dipping a rod in and out of the lead-grey waters. Nothing grows for miles around. This is you. This is <em>your</em> deteriorating mind up on that stage. You know nothing, you understand nothing; you’re still falling endlessly out of the coconut tree. That’s <em>your</em> desiccated, half-mummified body. Look at you: you’re a wreck. Maybe withered, maybe obese, maybe you got into bodybuilding purely to post photos of yourself online; either way, you can only cling on to mere biological life thanks to a planet-girdling meshwork of supply chains and machines, about which you know less than nothing. Just like Joe Biden, you have total power over everything you survey. Yours the hand that taps the screen and makes the pixels to dance. But somehow, all this power has left you feeling rudderless and confused. You’re tired all the time, even though you never really do anything. You live in terror of the hurtling that carries you from year to year. America is still the world’s greatest representative democracy: who could possibly be a better or more accurate representation than good old Tremblin’ Joe? </p><p>But now the liberal establishment are scared. These people all knew; they all spent the last five years propping up this presidential scarecrow. They thought the rest of us wouldn’t be able to see it. Every time Biden started spontaneously bleeding from his eyes, or mumbling to people who weren’t there, or just wandered off in the middle of a press conference, they thought they could explain it away. Look, this is selectively edited, it’s disinformation, it’s a right-wing narrative, and do you really want to be repeating <em>right-wing narratives</em>? Anyway, the other guy is a convicted felon, which is even worse, so you have absolutely no choice but to line up behind this wandering dementia patient. Maybe they even believed it. But when they pushed their hollow golem up in front of the cameras and saw how he looked, suddenly they understood that the illusion wasn’t working. Panic. I’ve seen speculation that the DNC planned this all ahead of time: they arranged this catastrophe before the convention, so they could ditch Biden and pick someone else, but after the primaries, so <em>they</em> would get to pick the replacement instead of the voting public. Don’t believe a word. What you’re observing is the panic of someone looking at a mirror for the first time in half a decade. All they know is that they want someone else. Someone younger. Someone more cogent. Someone who can reliably control their streams of piss and shit. Gretchen Whitmer, maybe, some lab-extruded lib from Michigan. Or Gavin Newsom, who looks like he could play the president in a straight-to-Netflix action thriller. You people have learned nothing! Everyone agrees that Biden’s debate performance was terrible, but the polls show they’re still willing to vote for him. The beedle hasnt moved; in fact, <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/538-ipsos-june-2024-presidential-debate-poll">one poll</a> had him two points <em>up</em>. Why on earth would you assume that America even wants<em> </em>someone cogent, or someone who can control the flow of their piss and shit? Did you not see the last guy? Did you not notice that he’s back? </p><p>None of this is to say that Biden can definitely beat Trump in November. Even if he’s the true king of America, kings do sometimes fall in battle. He still stands a much better chance than Gretchen Whitmer or Gavin Newsom or—to pick an absurd comedy third option—Kamala Harris, but in the end I’m not even sure it matters. I don’t know how you can live through the last eight years, in which we had two presidents who were both obviously mentally incapacitated, and conclude that the person in the White House is even remotely significant. Both of them should have been utterly and unprecedentedly disastrous. They weren’t, not really. Some sleaze, some internal chaos for the freaks who pay obsessive attention to the news, but the world did not end. Would the pandemic have been any shorter or the inflation any gentler with some drab technocrat in office? Hard to say. I don’t mean that the president is powerless: he’s almost infinitely powerful, but that power is the infinite power to commit acts of cruelty. Essentially, the president has the ability to murder tens of thousands of people in the Middle East whenever he wants. Since all of them without exception do precisely this, it’s not clear the electoral system can really do anything to help us here. If it’s <em>politics</em> you care about, the collective transformation of the world, you’re looking in the wrong place. </p><p>But the president has another, subtler power. He orchestrates the vibes. He gets to be on TV a lot; people have to pay attention to him and the things he says. Both Trump and Biden are great at this, which is why the artless liberal mainstream is now so desperate to shed both of them. They want some fortysomething bureaucrat to briskly outline the issues of the day. Some gloss of corporate competence sprayed over the rot. But it won’t happen. The coup will fail, the panic will splutter out, and you will not replace King Joe. It’s not so bad, what’s coming. You will get to witness a titanic man simply fading away in front of you. America’s national tone will be set by its president’s steady retreat, deper and deeper into the wrinkles of his own skin. You will get to turn on the news every day and glory in the last great mystery of the world, which is its vanishing. </p>

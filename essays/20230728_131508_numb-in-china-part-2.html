You used to be cool.’ For the entire history of the concept, cool has essentially been an American product, even if its manufacture was occasionally farmed out to subsidiaries in France and Japan. Despite some heroic efforts, the Soviet Union never managed to produce cool at anything like industrial levels. But what about China? Was China, in fact, once cool? Is it still cool now? Is cool simply an index of assimilation into global culture, or are indigenous cools possible? </em></p><p><em>From now until September, Numb at the Lodge will be in China, investigating these questions and more.

They are also not bad. Beijing is vibeless. The city simply has no vibes.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>You’re not supposed to admit this sort of thing, because it marks you out as a slack-jawed provincial and the locals will laugh at you, but the first time I saw New York as an adult I was overwhelmed. Even after Guliani and the big cleanup and 9/11 and everything else, the city had an intensity to it, like a hive of screaming hornets. Every individual New Yorker might have been miserable, shuttling wearily from cramped apartment to dull office to tryhard bar, but the overall effect was one of immense activity. So much was happening; so much overflowing life packed into every inch of dense cystic urban matter. And I fully expected that being in Beijing would feel like that all over again. High-pressure China, country of billions, bursting at its seams, spewing out new tracts of city on a daily basis, a torrent of China roaring around my ears. This is not what I found.</p><p>Apparently some places in China really are like this. Shanghai, Chongqing. (Stay tuned; we’ll be finding out soon.) Beijing—not so much. Officially, the capital is home to some twenty-one million people, making it the third-biggest city in the world. But the people I’ve talked to all half-jokingly insist that this is the CCP fudging the statistics, maybe inventing whole neighbourhoods, and there are really only ten million here, maybe five. Because where is everyone? The streets in Beijing are quiet. Traffic flows at a very gentle pace along broad wide avenues; the most common vehicles are the creepily silent electric scooters. There are long queues for the big tourist attractions, Tiananmen Square and the Temple of Heaven, but then you get inside and they’re practically abandoned. Even inside the second ring road, every monumental building backs on to a slumbering maze of low apartment blocks. Every restaurant is half-empty, even the really good ones. One or two idle shoppers in the malls. There doesn’t seem to be anyone here.</p><p>This is, in fact, the result of a deliberate policy choice. Starting in 2015, the local Communist Party launched a campaign to kick out some of the millions of migrant workers who’d come to the capital from the poorer provinces. Slum neighbourhoods cleared and replaced with plasticky towers. Annual quotas for population reductions in the downtown core. The Party’s objective is to build a Beijing that reflects its status as the seat of government: to turn it into one of those antiseptic planned capitals like Canberra or Abuja or Islamabad or Washington DC. Which means eradicating the city’s working-class culture and replacing it with lots of malls, where you can buy your Uniqlo and your H&amp;M and get a coffee from Tim Horton’s on your way out. And which also meant the end of the line for the coolest people on Earth.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40be2f50-fef1-40c4-a4a4-8c144889ea9c_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40be2f50-fef1-40c4-a4a4-8c144889ea9c_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40be2f50-fef1-40c4-a4a4-8c144889ea9c_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40be2f50-fef1-40c4-a4a4-8c144889ea9c_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40be2f50-fef1-40c4-a4a4-8c144889ea9c_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40be2f50-fef1-40c4-a4a4-8c144889ea9c_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/40be2f50-fef1-40c4-a4a4-8c144889ea9c_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:541151,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40be2f50-fef1-40c4-a4a4-8c144889ea9c_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40be2f50-fef1-40c4-a4a4-8c144889ea9c_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40be2f50-fef1-40c4-a4a4-8c144889ea9c_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40be2f50-fef1-40c4-a4a4-8c144889ea9c_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Because while they lived, the coolest people on Earth were the Beijing punks, and it wasn’t even close. In China, punk really meant something, in a way it hasn’t in the West since the 1970s, or maybe not at all. And the music was <em>good</em>, even in the scene’s final years. P.K.14 are good. Carsick Cars are <em>really</em> good. They were—and I know how this makes me sound—doing really interesting stuff with noise. Right when Western music nerds were all suddenly deciding that the most valid critical stance was to flap around like a twelve-year-old over overproduced commercial pop, Beijing was putting out some of the best guitar music this century.</p><p>Chinese punk existed as an idea long before there were actually any Chinese punk bands. In 1982, four years before Cui Jian put an electric guitar on Chinese national TV, the artist, Frenchman and weirdo Marc Boulet claimed to have come across a punk band in Guangzhou called Dragons, and went on to produce their first album, <em>Parfums de la Revolution</em>. Obviously, Dragons did not really exist. Boulet had <em>tried</em> to find a Chinese punk band while touring the country with Jean-Michel Jarre; failing, he’d simply invented one. Dragons were actually a French new wave band called Ici Paris, with vocals provided by three Cantonese guys Boulet picked up in the <em>Quartier asiatique</em>. Their album is actually kinda great; a particular highlight is the cover of <em>Anarchy in the UK</em>—in which the singers, obviously not knowing any English or even what they’re supposed to be doing, render all the lyrics as one continuous scream. (Again, I know this sounds like the kind of thing I’d make up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QLbI3O2JfeM">It’s not</a>.) But I really don’t think Chinese punk was just a straightforward Western import. When it actually emerged in the 1990s, it wasn’t in places like Guangzhou, port cities, special economic zones, plugged in directly to the world. It was in the tough scabby working-class regions of Wuhan and Beijing.</p><p>(This is not to say that there’s <em>no</em> imitation going on. China has an ultras culture now, for instance. A group of Beijing Guoan FC fans call themselves the Royal Army: they dress casual, shave their heads, get fat, drink beer, start fights, chant, and make Oi!-style punk songs about the team. They learned what to do by watching footage of British football hooligans online, and then—with the utmost diligence and obedience—copying them.)</p><p>One of the centres of the late Beijing punk scene—its CBGBs—was School Bar, a tiny space just south of the second ring road. People warned me that things had changed and the scene was now functionally dead. We went anyway, and found ourselves instantly the oldest people in the room. The audience were all eighteen-year-old middle-class Beijingers with bottle-blond hair; the performers were the same. Between songs, they chatted to the crowd with an easy, charismatic banter that seemed to have been honed on social media. Or maybe all these people knew each other. The music was very consistently low-energy. Shoegazey city pop, neo-soul; coffee-shop music, laced with occasional notes of ‘whoa-oh-oh-oh’ landfill indie and some laid-back gestures towards rapping. There wasn’t much pogoing, but lot of shuffling and bobbing heads. At one point one of the bands tried to organise a mosh pit, but all the teens only got confused by the big empty space they’d been told to form in front of the stage. The headliner was a girl called Clementine who sang sweet-but-sad city pop. She had a genuine stage presence. You could imagine her, in five years or so, talking about her days playing in slightly grimy punk bars: she’s not just any old manufactured pop star, she came out of the <em>avant-garde</em>. During her set, projectors showed a QR code so you could follow her on WeChat. Afterwards, some men yelled out from the crowd in Mandarin. ‘You’re so beautiful! Let me take you to dinner!’</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9892bbe-4113-4b7e-9b6f-b0d50f7eade6_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9892bbe-4113-4b7e-9b6f-b0d50f7eade6_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9892bbe-4113-4b7e-9b6f-b0d50f7eade6_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9892bbe-4113-4b7e-9b6f-b0d50f7eade6_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9892bbe-4113-4b7e-9b6f-b0d50f7eade6_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9892bbe-4113-4b7e-9b6f-b0d50f7eade6_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a9892bbe-4113-4b7e-9b6f-b0d50f7eade6_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:290741,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9892bbe-4113-4b7e-9b6f-b0d50f7eade6_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9892bbe-4113-4b7e-9b6f-b0d50f7eade6_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9892bbe-4113-4b7e-9b6f-b0d50f7eade6_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9892bbe-4113-4b7e-9b6f-b0d50f7eade6_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Punk is no longer in. Anger, rebellion, dissent: the cool eighteen-year-olds in China aren’t interested any more. In the 2010s, China was seized by an unprecedented wave of wildcat strikes in factories across the country; now, the level of labour militancy is almost zero. The dominant mode of youth revolt is ‘lying flat,’ working less, living with less, having less ambition, thinking less about politics, trying to enjoy the easy things in life as much as possible. And the experience of the pandemic—the way China managed to succesfully contain the virus, at least at first, while every other country did not—seems to have left a lot of people with the sense that maybe there’s nothing really to rebel against, and no real reason to be angry. Every year, life is a little bit cleaner, better, and more harmonious. Everything is under control.</p><p>The next day we dropped in on the 798 Art Zone on the outskirts of the city. This was once a sprawling factory complex, built by East German engineers, producing loudspeakers, radios, and other military and civilian electronics. When it was first built in the 1950s it was state of the art; by the 1980s, when new factories were being built in the south for the Western markets, it was surplus to requirements and closed down. In fairly short order, rats and artists started moving in. You should know how this goes by now. 798 is Beijing’s official hip neighbourhood, a functional clone of Brooklyn and Dalston and Berlin, mostly inhabited by brands. It was the only place in Beijing we heard <em>Western</em> pop music blaring out the cafés, instead of the local variant. (Taylor Swift, if you’re wondering.) An honest-to-god furry wandered around in her maroon foxsuit. There were galleries all over the place, and all the art was awful. Well, nothing new there; you’ll also encounter some uniformly bad art in Brooklyn and Dalston and Berlin, and if anything it’s usually <em>worse</em> outside the West. Contemporary artists from outside the West normally have two options. They can either make the same crappy installation work or basically decorative abstraction as everyone else—or they can produce modern art that nods to the artistic heritage of their country, hopefully nodding so vigorously that even a Miami curator will notice what’s going on. Turn your history into a fetish-object for Western art markets, and turn yourself into a basically mute conduit for that history. But for quite a while, Chinese artists seemed to have escaped that trap entirely. From the 1980s to the 2010s, Chinese artists were producing a lot of punky, punchy, nervy, edgy, queasy, <em>visceral</em> material that responded directly to the agonies and the excess of modern China. Huang Yong Ping; Ren Hang; Zhang Huan; Miao Xiaochun; Wang Gongxin. You can see a lot of that work in 798. It’s in the bookshops, in the art books. Meanwhile, the galleries are all displaying nice, placid works inspired by the techniques of classical watercolours or the forms of classical ceramics.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e66814-07b5-4eac-95a9-d9e862408454_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e66814-07b5-4eac-95a9-d9e862408454_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e66814-07b5-4eac-95a9-d9e862408454_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e66814-07b5-4eac-95a9-d9e862408454_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e66814-07b5-4eac-95a9-d9e862408454_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e66814-07b5-4eac-95a9-d9e862408454_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/52e66814-07b5-4eac-95a9-d9e862408454_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:272067,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e66814-07b5-4eac-95a9-d9e862408454_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e66814-07b5-4eac-95a9-d9e862408454_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e66814-07b5-4eac-95a9-d9e862408454_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e66814-07b5-4eac-95a9-d9e862408454_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Outside these little artsy zones, mainstream culture in China is all bubblegum, all syrupy and sweet. In other words, profoundly lame. The streets are still plastered with Communist Party propaganda, but there are no stern, stylised cadres clutching a rifle with one hand and the <em>Quotations</em> in the other. Cutesy little cartoon characters exhort you to hygeinically use communal chopsticks while transferring food from the bowl to your plate (‘It makes us healthy!’), or to ‘create a civilised urban area’ by helping old people cross the street. Chinese pop music is cheerful and asexual and absolutely everywhere. The <em>other</em> big mainstream music genre is, of course, hip-hop. In China, hip-hop is state music, military music even. There’s a big flashy TV talent show called <em>China Has Hip Hop,</em> in which aspiring Mandarin rappers are judged by a panel of mostly Taiwanese celebs, including one called MC HotDog. Maybe the most popular Chinese rap act at the moment is a Chengdu group called Higher Brothers. Sample lyrics: ‘The responsibility I feel is like the Chinese national team winning respect in swimming.’ </p><p>Hip-hop is global music now; it has very little to do with the black New Yorkers who invented it, even if they’re still occasionally rolled out for legitimation purposes. (The Higher Brothers song features a second-tier New York rapper called Famous Dex.) But what’s weird is that China is actually, in a sense, directly at the root of so much hip-hop. For a brief period, China formed an opposite pole to the globe-girdling universality of American culture. In Paris, in Mexico City, in Luanda, across the world, unimpeachably cool young people were listening to Radio Peking, speaking in slogans translated from Chinese, and carrying portraits of the Great Helmsman. All this was happening at the same time that China was systematically destroying its own cultural heritage and replacing it with something proletarian and universal: maybe this is just how global cultural hegemonies are made, a kind of kenosis. (America dominates world culture, but it’s also, for Europeans at least, <em>cultureless</em>, the ‘last primitive society,’ with everything just churned out by the market.) My uncle used to walk around with the Little Red Book in his jacket pocket. And in America, that book was required reading for the consummately cool members of the Black Panther Party. In 1971, Huey P Newton flew to China to meet Jiang Qing and Zhou Enlai. No Maoism, no Black Panthers; no Black Panthers, no hip-hop, not as we know it. But China no longer tries to produce its own forms of world-culture. Once again, it’s effacing its past; nobody likes to remember the 60s and 70s. Which is how hip-hop can reappear as a mark of neutral, global capitalist modernity, just like luxury brands and guided missiles. China needs hip-hop for the same reason it needs to win respect in Olympic swimming.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe763b3b-fd60-435b-ab57-538188cf91b8_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe763b3b-fd60-435b-ab57-538188cf91b8_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe763b3b-fd60-435b-ab57-538188cf91b8_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe763b3b-fd60-435b-ab57-538188cf91b8_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe763b3b-fd60-435b-ab57-538188cf91b8_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe763b3b-fd60-435b-ab57-538188cf91b8_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fe763b3b-fd60-435b-ab57-538188cf91b8_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:403128,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe763b3b-fd60-435b-ab57-538188cf91b8_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe763b3b-fd60-435b-ab57-538188cf91b8_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe763b3b-fd60-435b-ab57-538188cf91b8_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe763b3b-fd60-435b-ab57-538188cf91b8_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>As it happens, the site of the Beijing 2008 swimming competition is now an enormous waterpark called the Magic Happy Water Cube. And this was the only place in Beijing that my girlfriend really wanted to visit. She likes waterparks. A few years ago she’d seen a picture of the Magic Happy Water Cube online and ever since she’d been desperate to go. This vast tangle of slides and tornadoes all coiled up like a belly full of guts. The biggest waterpark in China. So we went: enough dour culture-critique; let’s just have some fun. </p><p>Inside, the huge moist space was crammed with Chinese families and their almost impossibly adorable kids. This, it turned out, was where all the Beijingers were hiding. People kept stopping us and asking where we were from. ‘Welcome to China,’ they said, almost pleading, so incredibly sincere. Their payment processors might be <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/numb-in-china-part-1">actively militating against foreign tourism</a>, but the Chinese people were so grateful we’d chosen to visit their country. They might be the friendliest people in the world. Welcome to China. Look at what we’ve built. This plastic palace of the people, dedicated only to the immense joy of rushing water and speed.</p><p>‘So you really love these places,’ I said to my girlfriend as we queued up for one of the slides. ‘I think I do!’ she said brightly. ‘But wait,’ I said, ‘you <em>have</em> been to one of these before, right?’ Her eyes darted. ‘Well,’ she said. ‘yes, I have, but not since I was a kid. But I love looking at pictures of them and I always thought it would be really nice to go to one.’ ‘Is there a chance,’ I said, ‘that it’ll turn out that you <em>don’t</em> actually like waterparks?’ She shook her head. ‘No. No, I don’t think so. I’m almost certain I love this.’ Later, I helped her up as the slide spit her out of its mouth. ‘That was,’ she said, ‘the most fun I’ve ever had in my life.’</p><p>And it was; it was really fun. Later they had a kind of live show by the wave pool. Three girls in sexy but still family-appropriate outfits danced and lipsynched to a sugary Chinese pop song. Another girl introduced herself as—I’m almost certain—DJ Custard and shouted cheerfully in English. The waves rolled and the lights flashed. There was a water cannon, randomly spraying the crowd. Kids stared at us and welcomed us to China. Bright, bright colours. Magic Happy. I thought about how cheap, historically, a human life has been in this country. Nearly half a million workers died building the Great Wall and were buried under its foundations. They called it the Longest Grave. During the Siege of Suiyan, the starving Tang defenders killed and ate half the entire civilian population of the city. In 1938, with the Japanese marching on Sichuan, the Chinese Nationalists blew up the dams on the Yellow River to halt their advance. Nearly a million people died from the floods. The operation was widely considered a success. Less than fifty years ago, well within living memory, this country was going through the convolutions of the Cultural Revolution. Systematic massacres, millions dead, maybe tens of millions, many tortured, some eaten. Even now there are places on the fringes of this country where certain things may or may not be happening that it’s best not to talk about. But here they were: the Chinese, some of the greatest sufferers of the twentieth century, in this bright happy place, having fun. </p><p>‘I can feel the energy in the house tonight!’ shouted DJ Custard. ‘Let’s keep this party going louder!’</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04f3c489-ec8e-421c-b841-0ed421ea1482_2048x2048.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04f3c489-ec8e-421c-b841-0ed421ea1482_2048x2048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04f3c489-ec8e-421c-b841-0ed421ea1482_2048x2048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04f3c489-ec8e-421c-b841-0ed421ea1482_2048x2048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04f3c489-ec8e-421c-b841-0ed421ea1482_2048x2048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04f3c489-ec8e-421c-b841-0ed421ea1482_2048x2048.jpeg" width="1456" height="1456" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/04f3c489-ec8e-421c-b841-0ed421ea1482_2048x2048.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1456,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:387093,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04f3c489-ec8e-421c-b841-0ed421ea1482_2048x2048.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04f3c489-ec8e-421c-b841-0ed421ea1482_2048x2048.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04f3c489-ec8e-421c-b841-0ed421ea1482_2048x2048.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04f3c489-ec8e-421c-b841-0ed421ea1482_2048x2048.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div>

The <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/strange-news-from-another-star-no-9d3">last full edition</a> was about dreams and death. It was also, at over seven thousand words, absurdly long—maybe too long, even for me. Free subscribers got what was essentially a full-length feature essay on dying in dreams, taking its cues from Freud and Kristeva, and featuring many examples sent in by readers. Paying subscribers got that, plus </em>another<em> full-length feature essay about dreams of the dead, with even more reader dreams, taking its cues from Homer, the Talmud, and the rogue Jungian James Hillman. </em></p><p><em>This month’s edition is about messages.

There’s a slightly precious early-twentieth-century tradition of setting stories in fantastic dreamlands, those unreal geographies full of crystal cities with names like Ulthar and Thalarion. (Honourable mention to Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky, though, who did it… differently.) Even now, when TV writers try to show us a dreamworld, what we end up with is usually depressingly twee: high spires with Gothic tracery; the inevitable dragon flying overhead. I am not sure anyone has ever actually had a dream that unfolded in that sort of place. (If you have, get in touch!) But I </em>have<em> had quite a few dreams set in China, despite never having actually been there, and more than a few of the readers’ dreams I’ve received have been set in China too. What does this mean? Is there someone in China dreaming a more deranged version of north London? Am I doing colonialism in my sleep? Is this what Xi Jinping meant with his ‘China Dream’ slogan? I’m excited to find out.</em></p><p><em>If you have an interesting dream of a faraway place you’d like to share—or if you’ve had any kind of interesting dream at all, or an interesting interpretation of any dreams submitted so far—you can contribute to </em>Strange News from Another Star<em> by replying to this email, or by emailing me at <strong><a href="mailto:samrkriss@gmail.com">samrkriss [at] gmail dot com</a></strong>, or by clicking the helpful button below:</em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;mailto:samrkriss@gmail.com&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Hi&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="mailto:samrkriss@gmail.com"><span>Hi</span></a></p><p><em>A few more pieces of news:</em></p><ul><li><p><em>I’ve been away in New York and Florida for a good chunk of the last month. Expect to hear more about both places before long, but while I was in New York I appeared on </em>Our Struggle<em>, a literary podcast that’s been profiled in the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2021-in-review/the-escapist-sounds-of-2021">New Yorker</a> and <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/06/how-a-wildly-unpopular-podcast-became-a-literary-world-sensation">Vanity Fair</a>, and whose previous guests include such luminaries as Will Self, Benjamin Moser, Sheila Heti, Geoff Dyer, and Gary Shteyngart. I’m told my episode is essentially unlistenable. It’s nearly two and a half hours long, and almost all of it is taken up by a rambling and pointless conversation about the snack platter the hosts provided, which consisted—for reasons that still aren’t clear—of some French cheese, a large salami, and an enormous block of white chocolate. Yes, I ate all three together. Yes, you can listen to me doing it. I also insisted that we not wear headphones during the recording, with the result that I’m almost inaudible, apart from when I’m crunching crisps directly into the mic. It’s basically an incredibly low-fi simulation of being forced to sit through someone else’s annoying conversation, which is apparently what you people want.

There’s some of the obligatory leftist-writing-for-a-right-wing-publication Marx-quoting, but I think it’s a fun piece.</em></p></li></ul><p><em>That’s all from the waking world. Into the night.</em></p><h4>Dream of the month</h4><p>My favourite reader dream since our last full edition is this one, from an anonymous reader:</p><blockquote><p>A friend tells me her parents have just recently had a baby boy named Facloris and they are coming over to let us meet him. They arrive and the baby is perfect, better than perfect.&nbsp;Everyone agrees they’ve never seen such a beautiful child, but there’s something else I don’t say, and I have the sense that others are thinking it too: his laughter, his wails, even his crying have a musicality to them that seems at once terribly sophisticated and utterly alien. Just as they are leaving, Facloris’ mother picks him up to feed him and I notice something. Facloris is deformed. His entire body is made up only of his perfect head, two small unformed legs, and two unsightly bone spurs emerging from the lower back of his head, where anyone else’s neck might be.<br><br>Weeks later, I’m listening to a lecture on ancient Greek poetry. The lecturer is describing the greatest of the ancient Greek poets, none of whose works survive, but who, it is said, will return one day to usher in a great age of poetry. He clicks for the next slide and there he is: the head of a goat atop long, avian legs, and large wings coming from the point where the legs meet the head. His name is Efklaris. Could it be?<br><br>I want to ask my friend if she knows anything about this, but I decide that I’ll wait to see her and bring it up casually. We have a plan to go to the pub, but when I arrive she isn’t there. She can’t see people at the moment; she’s too upset. Facloris has died at just shy of six months.</p></blockquote><p>Other people have met this Facloris before; Kafka wrote <a href="https://www.babelmatrix.org/works/de/Kafka%2C_Franz-1883/Eine_Kreuzung/en/34808-A_Crossbreed_%28A_Sport%29">an entire short story about him</a>. This is, in a way, the perfect dream, the dream about dreaming. Something is plopped in front of you: a mishmash, a sort of abomination, cobbled together from spare parts with all the important structures missing. It ought not to exist, but somehow it manages to be beautiful. (So many dreams seem to involve some kind of monstrosity, but <em>in the dream</em> it’s not remotely unpleasant and everything’s fine. See, for instance, the whale’s tail from <a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/strange-news-from-another-star-bonus">last time</a>.) This thing seems to reach to us from a very disant past. But only partway. Before long, the beautiful monster has to die, and it will not be understood.</p><h4>Messages</h4><p>We begin, as always, with the chemical structure of benzene. The benzene molecule is, as we all know, a ring of carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds, each joined to a single hydrogen atom. This structure was discovered by the great theoretical chemist August Kekulé; what’s unusual is <em>how</em> he discovered it. After months of fruitless effort, he fell asleep in front of his work one night in 1865, and had a dream of the ouroboros: the Gnostic and alchemical symbol of a snake eating its own tail. He woke with a start. ‘It’s a ring!’ he exclaimed. </p><p>In <em><a href="https://nautil.us/the-kekul-problem-236574/">The Kekulé Problem</a></em>, his only published nonfiction essay, the novelist Cormac McCarthy asks a very old question:</p><blockquote><p>Since the unconscious understands language perfectly well or it would not understand the problem in the first place, why doesn’t it simply answer Kekulé’s question with something like: ‘Kekulé, it’s a bloody ring’? To which our scientist might respond: ‘Okay. Got it. Thanks.’ Why the snake? That is, why is the unconscious so loath to speak to us? Why the images, metaphors, pictures? Why the dreams, for that matter?</p></blockquote><p>Freud’s answer is that this dream-work takes place to smuggle repressed desires through our internal censor. But it’s hard to see what might be uncomfortably erotic about the molecular structue of benzene. McCarthy has a different view. The unconscious, he says, <em>contra</em> Lacan, simply doesn’t like or resemble human language very much. It is, after all, much <em>older</em> than language; the unconscious is ‘a machine for operating an animal,’ untold millions of years old. It managed fine without language for almost all of that time, and it still does now: as McCarthy points out, most of us don’t actually do our real thinking in language; we just use our conscious internal monologue to sum up what’s emerged from ‘this pool of we-know-not-what and give it a linguistic form so that it can be expressed.’ This thing you imagine yourself to be, this conscious mind, is really just a thin layer on the surface of the unconscious, whose sole function it is to robotically repeat whatever the deep pool inside you chooses to divulge.</p><p>(The implication, which we’ll probably end up returning to at some point, is that animals—who (mostly) do not speak, and who (possibly) lack the interface of consciousness—are in some sense <em>always dreaming</em>.)</p><p>This idea can lead to some strange places. Almost every human society that’s ever existed has assumed that dreams are, at least sometimes, a <em>message</em> delivered to and for <em>us</em>, from some mystical outside entity. For the most part, this is what we still believe; we’ve just replaced the gods and spirits with our own unconscious minds. The point is still to unpack and interpret its communications. But McCarthy suggests that the dream is not really <em>for us</em> at all. It’s the unconscious working by itself, and for its own ends. When we sleep, we get to directly experience the prelinguistic animal-mind churning away beneath the surface of ourselves—but here we are intruders. This might explain why we forget so many of our dreams so soon after waking up. To dream is to step on sacred ground, where we were never meant to walk.</p><p>This is a fascinating idea, but it’s not what we’ll be pursuing today. Today, I’m interested in the counter-examples. Because sometimes, the unconscious really does seem to be talking directly to <em>you</em>. </p><p>This can sometimes even take place in the waking world. In 1984, a woman living in the UK began to hear voices in her head. They told her not to be afraid, and that they wanted to help her. She was extremely afraid. She sought emergency psychiatric treatment, and was duly diagnosed with functional hallucinatory psychosis and prescribed thioridazine. The antipsychotics silenced her voices, until one day they suddenly returned, with more news. The voices informed her that she had a tumour in her brain, and gave her an address in London that turned out to belong to a CT department. They told her to walk in and demand a brain scan. She was refused, because this is not how hospitals work, but her psychiatrist eventually requested the brain scan anyway. The point was to reassure the patient and prove to her that these voices were not conveying any useful information. But the tumour was there. A meningioma six centimetres long, extending clear through one brain hemisphere and into the other. After the tumour was removed, the patient heard her voices one last time. ‘We are pleased to have helped you,’ they said. ‘Goodbye.’</p><p>I should point out here that this story did not first appear in one of those bright-pink magazines with headlines like ‘I KILLED my abusive dad—now he’s COME BACK as a CROW.’ You can find it in the <em><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/315/7123/1685">British Medical Journal</a></em>, volume 315, pp. 1685-6.</p><p>Sometimes a dream will conjure a specific piece of information and practically scream in your face that <em>this is important</em>, that you need to pay attention to <em>this</em>. There is an object you’re looking for, a piece of paper, an email, a message. Borges gives us an instance in <em>The Secret Miracle</em>:</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><blockquote><p>Toward dawn, he dreamt he had hidden himself in one of the naves of the Clementine Library. A librarian wearing dark glasses asked him: What are you looking for? Hladik answered: God. The Librarian told him: God is in one of the letters on one of the pages of one of the 400,000 volumes of the Clementine. My fathers and the fathers of my fathers have sought after that letter. I've gone blind looking for it. He removed his glasses, and Hladik saw that his eyes were dead. A reader came in to return an atlas. This atlas is useless, he said, and handed it to Hladik, who opened it at random. As if through a haze, he saw a map of India. With a sudden rush of assurance, he touched one of the tiniest letters. An ubiquitous voice said: The time for your work has been granted. Hladik awoke.</p></blockquote><p>When I was maybe twelve years old, I had a dream in which I had to carry an incredibly important piece of information. I was in a bunker, a maze of underground tunnels and command posts like the ones built under London during the Second World War, and we had just received a fax. My job was to carry a single folded-over sheet of fax paper to some commander in his distant node of the warren, and on no condition was I to even <em>think</em> about unfolding the paper and seeing what it said. This message held a crucial secret: it was the thing that would make everything make <em>sense</em>. It would explain why we have conscious experience and why we die, whether or not there is a God and what he wants from us, the future of our civilisation and my own private destiny. I made it quite a long time without giving in to the temptation, but eventually I had to look. Almost as soon as I did, I woke up. But I got a glimpse. The fax consisted of a series of oscillating graphs, something like a seismonitor or a polygraph reading, each labelled with the name of a Warsaw Pact state. I sent most of the next day in school trying to recreate what I’d seen. I’m still slightly convinced that if I’d managed to remember the exact shape of the frequencies, it would have been possible to decode the message, to turn it into sound or data, and discover the secret at the heart of everything.</p><p>Some of you have also been receiving dream-messages of this type. Often, the message is a message <em>within the dream</em>. Sandra dreamed that she received an email that said: ‘There are now six wolves circling your house. Pray we do not see fit to add a seventh.’ (The image of six or seven wolves outside the house has an obvious psychoanalytic pedigree. Freud might have read the Wolf Man’s dream, but have our dreams been reading Freud?) An anonymous subscriber dreamed that a reel of ticker tape suddenly started outputting the phrase ‘IT IS NOT EASY TO BE BRAVE IN A PLACE OF SUCH SAFETY.’ Children were gleefully cutting out this repeated message with safety scissors and gluing them onto the covers of all their schoolbooks. David writes in with a dream about an entirely new communications infrastructure. In his dream, he’s in a majority-Catholic country. This country has automated signs on all the street crossings, not unlike the ones that tell drivers their speed, but these are printed with big white letters reading ‘YOUR CONFIRMATION NAME IS:’. Every time David crosses the street, he’s told that his new name is to be Antoni Savaletti.</p><p>Or sometimes a message within a dream is given weight by the person who delivers it, as in this dream from Joey:</p><blockquote><p>The context immediately fell away from me upon my waking in the middle of the night, but in the dream, Henry James reminded me to either stuff my ears with wax or bind myself to the mast. I do not know how he delivered the message, but I know it was him. I woke with the feeling that I should write the message down. I'll leave the augury to the experts, but it seems to me that the significance of the message, which by itself might seem old hat, has everything to do with the messenger.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>A dream from Alex seems to deploy both strategies at once. He dreamed that he came home to find that the power had been cut to his apartment. He went down to the basement to find the fusebox, but when he flipped the switch for his apartment he also pushed a mysterious ‘big, flat yellow button’ that instantly cut out the electricity for his entire building. He instantly heard a chorus of shouts and curses from the floors above, and angry footsteps tramping downstairs, so he hid. There was a kind of storage cellar at the far side of the basement, which he barricaded himself inside, only to find that a slit in the cellar opened up onto a tunnel of the Frankfurt U-Bahn. We’re deep underground now, in the caverns, the place of secrets. Trains dragged in front of the opening with an ‘unnatural slowness, like I was looking at it from another train driving parallel with nearly the same speed.’ On one train, an Indian family was being bothered by their eight-year-old daughter, who kept asking where they were and why they were moving so slowly. When Alex looked again she was on the tracks. She ran to catch up with the train, but before she did she shouted over her shoulder at him: ‘You will find your father and your people in South Tirol and you will never have to wear a mask again.’ The rest of the dream is hazy, but it culminated in an ascent up an ornate Art Nouveau staircase to a place of pure brilliant white light. ‘As of now,’ Alex comments, ‘I don’t intend to ever visit South Tirol to see what this was all about.’ </p><p>Dreams can also deliver messages by sheer force of repetition. Sam submits a dream that took place in a private members’ club, attended by Tory MPs and business leaders. In the dream, these titanic poshos were playing a ‘sort of ritualistic quiz game.’ Sam explains:</p><blockquote><p>Someone from the audience was invited up on stage to rapturous applause. The quizmaster would then ask a very simple question. ‘What is the capital of France?’ The audience member would then pretend not to know the answer, rubbing his chin (they were all men) and scratching his head, before giving a wrong answer on purpose—’Belgrade?’—at which point the crowd would chant ONE MORE CHANCE. ONE MORE CHANCE. ONE MORE CHANCE. Again, he’d feign ignorance and offer another wrong answer, and the crowd would chant ONE MORE CHANCE. Finally, after a few rounds of this, the audience member would appear to be struck by a thought and give the correct answer: ‘Paris!’ But once again, the audience would chant ONE MORE CHANCE. ONE MORE CHANCE. ONE MORE CHANCE.</p></blockquote><p>But every so often, the message simply announces itself. Adam Green of the <em><a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/">Public Domain Review</a></em> tells me that he has been keeping a journal for several years now, in which he records the strange messages he receives in his dreams. Some selections:</p><blockquote><p>12/1/19: The sweep below of a grand garden perhaps darkening to night. And upon a balcony someone’s voice, sage-like and very distinct: ‘Someday we will have to reconsider this notion of time. Dante would have passed by only last Tuesday, and the terrifying red ring of hell just the circular mark of a coffee cup.’</p><p>8/9/19: ‘The Zone of Tomb Fire’&nbsp;</p><p>10-11/5/20: For the last two nights I’ve started awake in the early hours with the searing image, and overwhelming sense, of the number 1. As though branded from some other world into this.&nbsp;</p><p>6/12/21: Just an image. By a bridge, in the yellow buzz of a streetlight, the top of a lorry which reads “PLAGUE: IMPORTANCE OF THE TERRIFIED”, and just beside it a zone of pollarded trees, the sprawling tops all spiky in the light.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>These messages are barely mediated. They arrive in a great thunderclap of obscure meaning that’s still ringing in your ears when you wake up. I think I might have experienced something similar. The night after I took the covid booster in late 2021, turning in my sweaty half-fevered nausea, I received an extremely vivid signal. This dream—if it was a dream—had no visual component. There was only a voice, and it sounded deeply electronically distorted, a low staticky growl on just this side of pure white noise. It said:</p><blockquote><p>What you are hearing has not been electronically distorted. This is my real voice. I suffer from a rare condition that attacks my throat and lungs. For this reason I was hired by a group of international criminals to maintain their anonymity while handling their communications with the police and the general public. For some decades, this group has carried out a series of brutal armed robberies involving civilian deaths. They are also responsible for the recent atrocities. I have now been authorised to divulge the name of the group’s leader. That name follows: Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II.</p></blockquote><p>Then there was the sudden sound of a gunshot, and I woke up—if what I’d heard was really a dream. Or, if what I’d heard was a warning surreptitiously coded into the vaccine’s mRNA by unknown parties to unpack itself in my brain at night, then the transmission ended. </p><p>Those were its exact words. I know because as soon as I was able, I sat up in bed and jotted down the entire thing verbatim. Famously, Samuel Taylor Coleridge did the same thing in 1797. Having consumed a few grains of opium ‘to check a dysentry’ (believe that if you want), he fell asleep, and in his dream he received some three hundred lines of poetry. When he woke, he immediately started scribbling them down, but after being interrupted by a visitor, he found that while he still had ‘some vague and dim recollection of the general purport of the vision, yet, with the exception of some eight or ten scattered lines and images, all the rest had passed away.’ The lines that survive were published as <em>Kubla Khan</em>, which you already know:</p><blockquote><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text">In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

	Down to a sunless sea...</pre></div></blockquote><p>Borges—whose name is likely to keep coming up—makes a startling observation about this poem. Kublai did indeed build a magnificent palace in Shangdu that subsequently fell into ruin. But he built it after receiving detailed architectural plans <em>in a dream</em>. This information is known to us thanks to the <em>Jami al-Tawarikh</em> of Rashid al-Din Hamadani, a fourteenth-century Persian Jewish historian of the Mongols and a vizier to their descendents in the Ilkhanate. But even Coleridge, who is sometimes named as the last person to have read every single published book, could not have known this. No part of the <em>Jami al-Tawarikh</em> was translated into any European language until after Coleridge’s death. Borges, struggling for an explanation, concludes that ‘perhaps an archetype not yet revealed to men, an eternal object (to use Whitehead’s term), is gradually entering the world; its first manifestation was the palace; its second was the poem. Whoever compared them would have seen that they were essentially the same.’</p><p>But possibly the most fascinating message-dreams are the ones that are fascinating precisely because they are mundane. James writes that they’ve recently started a job at a consultancy. This is apparently stressful work, and has not just consumed the waking world, but the other world too. James describes a dream in which an old boss gave some advice on generating reports through Jira, their project management tool. ‘It was good advice.’ Another dream, originally posted to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/james-burt_agile-safe-softwaredevelopment-activity-7010877065428090880-UZQ4">LinkedIn</a>, goes like this:</p><blockquote><p>I had a crazy dream about #agile (well, #safe, which may or may not count as agile). I asked an architect colleague which team should take on some rework on an API boundary. He said it should be resolved by something called a ‘shove session.’ A representative from each team goes into a circle drawn in some sand, and whoever was pushed out of this circle first took on the API change. In the dream, this seemed like a perfectly sensible aspect of the scaled agile framework. #softwaredevelopment #agilemindset</p></blockquote><p>I’m not sure I understand this, and where I do understand I can’t really say that I approve. Human beings have survived for a very long time without ever reworking an API boundary, and maybe things would be better if we stopped. But unlike many of the dreams I’ve collected here, James’ pass the McCarthy test. They communicate meaningful, actionable data in a way that the phrase ‘IT IS NOT EASY TO BE BRAVE IN A PLACE OF SUCH SAFETY’ or the fiery intensity of the digit 1 do not. Our dreams <em>can</em> do this. But even when they seem desperate to pass on a particular piece of linguistic information, that information can sometimes still obey the strange and unclear rules of the other world.</p><p>Maybe it’s for the best that we do not always understand these messages. In <em>The Ghosts of Birds</em>, Eliot Weinberger collects some of the dreams experienced across several thousand years of history by people called Chang. One in particular stands out:</p><blockquote><p>It was recorded in the 6th century, in the <em>History of the Southern Ch’i Dynasty</em>, that Chang Ching’er’s wife told him: ‘A long time ago I dreamed my hands were as hot as fire, and you became Administrator of Nan-yang Commandery. Then I dreamed that half my body was as hot as fire and you became Magistrate of Hsiang-yang. Last night I dreamed that my entire body was as hot as fire.’ It was ecorded that a eunuch overheard the conversation and reported it to the Emperor, and it was noted that, a few days later, Chang Ching’er was executed. </p></blockquote>

This is the international headquarters of the Joyousness Movement, also known as the Joy-Joys, which was founded in California in 1967 and is not a cult. They’re trying to teach me meditation. I sit on a tatami mat, dressed in scratchy white robes, while an ancient, liver-spotted sub-guru wanders around, giving instructions in his New Jersey croak. When you breathe in, he says, imagine yourself as a flowah. You’re just a flowah. Feel the lightness of your body: you are a flowah. So I imagine myself as a flower. My body splayed outwards, lacerated into petals. An enormous wet sexual wound at the centre. I imagine myself bursting into cocks. A ring of thick hairy cocks all around my sugar-seeping wound. That’s a flower, that’s what a flower is; it’s the genital organ of a plant. </p><p>I think I might not be cut out for meditation. </p><p>I try to do it the way they’ve taught me. I try to simply notice these images as they rise to the surface of my consciousness, not following them, not suppressing them either, not judging. It’s hard. You don’t know what it’s like inside my head. It’s a tiny place, and it keeps being invaded by a rush of spiky little demons: gnashings of fur and claws, some of them no bigger than flies, razorblades vibrating in the air, emitting stupid phrases in foreign accents, Russian, Chinese, or sometimes just wordless gibbering: my thoughts. At least, I assume they’re mine. Maybe in the same sense that the bullet that finally gets you is also yours. When they’re not exploding my body into bits and penises, my thoughts keep up a constant stream of inane bullshit. This meditation posture isn’t as comfortable as it was half an hour ago, they say. You’re hungry. You’re thirsty. You’re horny. You need to piss. One day, your skin will look like that sub-guru’s, all creased up like tissue paper, drooping from your spindly arms. And isn’t it funny to be here, in the depths of India, with so many Americans? </p><p>I’ve been thinking a lot about America in these meditation sessions, whether I want to or not. I’m thinking about the fact that when Columbus arrived in the New World, he was looking for India. The place he actually found was only an obstacle, a gold-bearing swamp between the man and his destination. The spices and mystery of India, where half-naked holy men sit on mountains and think about nothing. Maybe this is why, when the United States was established, it couldn’t just sit still in its borders; it had to <em>keep going</em>. Press westward, continue Columbus’s trajectory, towards California and the sea. ‘Passage O soul to India!’ Thoreau reading the <em>Gita</em> in his hut, making Walden pond into his own personal Ganges. Emerson building his new American cosmology out of refashioned scraps from the Vedas. And once the frontier closed, the tough, dusty, knife-fight encampments on that distant coast suddenly became obsessed with Indian spirituality. Reincarnation, past lives, the Universal Mind. The hippie counterculture is just the most recent model. Before that they were making tantric fire-sacrifices at the Jet Propulsion Lab; before that Swami Vivekananda had the state’s Victorian aristocracy abandoning their chintzy homes to wander the coast as holy beggars. California yearns across the sea, to India. The whole of America is just Europe’s yearning, across the centuries, for India…</p><p>The fictional Indian state of Parpakainilam is in the south of the country, sandwiched between Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. For thousands of years, great empires welled up and drained away in the valleys below. The Cholas, the Pandyas, the Vijayanagaras—while up in their inaccessible hills the Parpakai barely paid any attention. They were far too focused on chewing the mildly psychoactive bark of the tevaiya tree and building weird stone temples with twisting organic forms. Even now, this place is a nightmare to get to, but there is a rail line from Bangalore to Kanturava, the state capital. Every two days, a train clatters and wheezes up the mountains and over the rusting old bridges spanning the ravines. I stood in the vestibule, leaning out the open door, looking down into that sheer sheer drop where the green hills fade into mist. It took sixteen hours before we creaked into the station at Kanturava, the city of terraces and balconies carved into the wall of an enormous cliff, where the ladders have more traffic than the roads. Parpakainilam still barely considers itself part of India. It has the lowest enlistment rate to the Indian Armed Forces of any state, and the lowest voter turnout. None of the national political parties have ever managed to get a foothold here; instead of Congress and the BJP, the Legislative Assembly is split between the Wakefulness Party and the Party of Dreams. Parpakainilam isn’t even covered by the India Post Office; it has its own informal postal service, based on the ancient kaikku system, in which a letter is passed on, sometimes by hundreds of people, in the vague direction of the recipient. In the more remote regions it can take years to get a postcard, and this ashram is in a very remote region. It’s a six-hour drive from Kanturava, and after that you have to do the last three hours on foot, through forests and over rope bridges and past ancient stone statues wreathed in vines that inexplicably shoot fire from their mouths when you pass. It was not a nice journey. But I made here, to the White Hermitage Ashram in its damp valley, to learn about Indian mysticism and spirituality from the people who understand it best—that is, from Americans.</p><p>A day at the White Hermitage Ashram begins at five in the morning with two hours of guided meditation. After that, there’s a fire ceremony in which we worship the Universal Mind, incarnated as a marble statue of Guru Raj Hansi as he looked in the late 60s, long hair, long trailing beard, big handsome wide-open face. Then a simple, traditional ashram breakfast of foot loops and cap’n crunch, served with milk from the ashram cows and tevaiya bark for chewing, eaten in silence. After that, there’s six hours of uninterrupted work. Sweeping, cleaning, mucking out the cattle, hosing down the toilets, washing clothes, running the ashram’s social media accounts. (I keep asking to help with the animals; they keep forcing me to sit in a stuffy, windowless room and tweet.) At two in the afternoon we sit together and eat lunch, usually a big bag of crisps with more tevaiya. The next four hours are for personal reflection, meditation, study, and informal group exercises, before another aarti, a silent dinner of lentil burgers or tofu dogs, and bed. But it used to be very different. The White Hermitage Ashram is huge. Its dining hall is huge, its kitchens are huge, its laundry looks like an industrial operation. There are housing units in this valley ten storeys high. At its peak in the 1970s, there were six thousand people living, working, and praying here. Back then, before Guru Raj Hansi went into seclusion, a good chunk of the day was taken up by gurudarshan: thousands of Joy-Joys would arrange themselves around the Guru, radiantly nude, and just stare at him, enraptured, soaking up the blissful energies that radiated from his silent, smiling form. Then he would say a few, simple words. Joy is not something you are seeking, he would say. Joy is already here. This was usually followed by an enormous session of ecstatic group sex. The Joyousness Movement was casting off five thousand years of shame and jealousy. They were finding the joy bursting out everywhere from the look, the touch, the feeling of warm skin against your own. Sex is a form of meditation, one of the most powerful forms of meditation. Through pleasure or procreation, sex dissolves you into the great stream of being; it’s through sex that you can come to understand the first mahavakya, <em>tat tvam asi</em>, thou art that. You are the existent, you are the universal self, you are everything and everyone. Fall into an ocean of firm, tanned, supple flesh, without questioning whether this flesh you’re touching belongs to a friend, a stranger, a man, a woman, an adult, a child…</p><p>Apparently they do still have sexual meditation at the White Hermitage Ashram, but I haven’t seen any. Today there are about fifty Joy-Joys still here, and they are not as firm and tanned and supple as they were. They creak around the place in their orange robes, with trembling hands and purple blotches on their skin, and the ashram is in ruins. We eat in one tiny corner of the dining hall. The machinery in the laundry is all gummed up, leaking toxic sludge; we wash our clothes in the river. Trees are growing out of the roofs of the high-rises, as their roots slowly crack the concrete open. All the young sexy kids back in America are still into spirituality, but it’s a very different kind. Taylor Swift has not yet started making pop songs based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Sabrina Carpenter is not singing about how the physical universe is an illusion. The kids might still do yoga and say namaste, and they still think there’s a universal consciousness that’s ultimately identical with their own self—but they’re no longer interested in renouncing desire or achieving union with the divine. They don’t want to escape the material world. They don’t want enlightenment. They are driving their bodies like cars, and they have no interest in getting out. At no point do you have to go on any kind of pilgrimage to India. It’s all about manifesting: using the fact that you’re a facet of the Infinite Mind to <em>get the stuff you want</em>. More money, more Instagram followers. The question isn’t why Westerners became obsessed with Indian spirituality: it’s why we stopped.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe90d7d6a-7da5-437b-be6f-def76969347e_1024x1024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe90d7d6a-7da5-437b-be6f-def76969347e_1024x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe90d7d6a-7da5-437b-be6f-def76969347e_1024x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe90d7d6a-7da5-437b-be6f-def76969347e_1024x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe90d7d6a-7da5-437b-be6f-def76969347e_1024x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe90d7d6a-7da5-437b-be6f-def76969347e_1024x1024.jpeg" width="1024" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e90d7d6a-7da5-437b-be6f-def76969347e_1024x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:232273,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe90d7d6a-7da5-437b-be6f-def76969347e_1024x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe90d7d6a-7da5-437b-be6f-def76969347e_1024x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe90d7d6a-7da5-437b-be6f-def76969347e_1024x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe90d7d6a-7da5-437b-be6f-def76969347e_1024x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>To be fair, I’m not the only visitor here seeking wisdom and enlightenment from the Joyousness Movement; there’s also Anil. I met Anil during my first tofu-dog dinner here. We hung out for a while in the great empty dining hall afterwards, even though we’re not supposed to stay out after dark, when the ashram belongs to the hundreds of feral pigs with razor-sharp tusks that now inhabit its ruins. Anil is twenty-four, which makes him the only other person here under seventy. He’s not the only Indian here, though; he’s an American like everyone else. (I think I could tell before he even spoke, when we were just nodding over our silent hot dogs: Indians from India and overseas Indians do not look anything even remotely like each other. They hold their faces differently.) Anil was born in Dallas, which he hates. The most interesting thing anyone ever did in Dallas, he said, was get shot in the head. His father is a research physicist at UT Arlington, his mother is a tax accountant. The least spiritual people you’ll ever meet, he said. He had never been particularly spiritual either. When he was sixteen Anil left to study computer science at MIT and then at Stanford. He ended up leading an AI integration research team at a big Bay Area tech company he won’t name, but he assured me I’ve definitely heard of it. Technically, he’s still working there; the firm gives him a lot of latitude to carry out his research however he wants, and imagining himself as a flower for several hours a day apparently falls under that umbrella. Anil came to India eight months ago to undertake market research: he wanted to know why people were so much more positive about AI, and so much more eager to integrate it into their lives, than anywhere else. He flew to Bangalore and got a desk at his company’s office there. And then, without warning, he had an awakening.</p><p>It’s true that Indians use AI a lot. I’ve already mentioned that practically every surface here is plastered with an AI-generated image of one or another deity, but it’s everywhere. The <em>Times of India</em> has a daily feature called HistoryMeetsAI, in which they illustrate a historical event with a bizarre and inaccurate AI-generated image. Hard to imagine the <em>Guardian </em>or the <em>New York Times</em> doing the same. Tourist guides routinely illustrate the local attractions with AI-generated images of fantastic Mughal palaces, tier on tier of onion domes floating into the clouds. If you’re dumb enough to actually go, you’ll usually discover a pile of old stones surrounded by trash and inhabited by feral dogs. But this all makes a certain cultural sense. In India they worship the visible aspects of something invisible, and cover temples with layer on layer of tiny intricate carvings; a machine that generates infinite images out of essentially nothing is not that far from the Hindu notion of God. There’s even something about the <em>style</em>, that default Midjourney style in which all the textures are too smooth and every object seems to glow with its own inner light. Something from the heavenly world: a shining thing, a deva, a god. Meanwhile, a distressing proportion of all written language in this country is written in ChatGPTese. There was the pizzeria that told me, on the front of its menus, that ‘it’s more than a meal—it’s a tale of woodfired epiphany,’ and went on to promise ‘a culinary journey like no other’ that would ‘transport you to a realm where boundaries dissolve.’ In a park they’d installed a big chrome tube chime, which they’d called the Tap Tong, along with an explanatory sign. ‘Tap Tong, a rhythmic marvel, an essence of percussive exploration. With its unique design it combines the precision of tapping and the resonance of tonging to create a captivating symphony.’ At a coffee shop in Bangalore, they described the various beans available. One was from Colombia. ‘Enter the diverse landscapes of Colombia, where coffee cultivation flourishes amongst the rolling hills.’ Another from Brazil. ‘Venture into the bustling streets of Sao Paulo, where coffee culture permeates every corner of daily life.’ Once you know how the machines talk, it’s impossible not to notice it: that eager, guileless, inhuman voice, always chirping its readiness to whisk you off on a magical journey into the black and touchless world where it does not live. </p><p>Anil told me that if you go on Twitter these days, any post with more than around 10,000 retweets is utterly swamped with replies from blue-check accounts using ChatGPT to restate the original post in less funny or interesting terms. Hundreds of responses that all say ‘That’s so true! Men and women really do have different expectations when it comes to cleanliness in different rooms of the house!’ Twitter pays verified accounts per number of impressions, so this eager, guileless babble can end up making a decent amount of money. It’s a good deal, if you don’t mind the whole of Twitter turning from a zone of human language into a slop-puddle of linguistic grey goo, a book written by the bookworms, which I don’t. Anil doesn’t mind either; his job is to get people to do this <em>more</em>. But when he looked at the accounts that were doing it, he noticed an unavoidable pattern. They all had names like Premanand and Vishal and Sudhir and Mahesh and, well, Anil. And what’s up with that?</p><p>Anyway, Anil was in Bangalore trying to work all this out, the AI scientist suddenly turned cultural anthropologist, and he did learn a few things. In fact, he started to think that India had discovered AI several thousand years ago. In most religions, the holy texts are considered to have been written or inspired directly by God. Not in Hinduism. The Vedas are <em>apaurusheya</em>, authorless, not made by human or any hands. They’re a pure manifestation of the grammar of Sanskrit, the true and eternal language. Anil asked me if I’d heard of Panini. I thought he was about to construct some elaborate metaphor about how recent inventions can develop a weird antiquity. Like how ciabatta was only invented in the 1980s? I said. No dude, he said, not the sandwich, Panini the <em>linguist</em>. He lived in like 700 BC and he was the first person to fully describe the grammar of any language. But get this, his grammar was also <em>generative</em>. He reduced the entire Sanskrit language to a series of mathematical operations, and you can use those to produce new sentences out of nothing. His math is… it’s difficult to understand. I didn’t think anyone’d actually been able to make it work. But I thought, why not just simulate it? Book in a few hours of compute time, upload the four thousand sutras of the <em>Ashtadhyayi</em> and all its operations, tack on a little interface, and… What? I said. It <em>worked</em>, said Anil. It’s a fucking chatbot. It only works in classical Sanskrit, and it doesn’t have any clue what it is or why it exists, but you can have a great chat with the sentient principle of the true and eternal language. It’s very easy to talk to.</p><p>To be honest, I find Anil difficult to talk to. I like him, but he’s full of the zeal of the convert. Whenever I try to air some minor British gripe about this rotting nursing home of an ashram, or its strict meditational schedule, or Indian spirituality in general, he suddenly gets very earnest. He’s obsessed with Guru Raj Hansi, and almost as obsessed with Swami Radha, the Joy-Joy who brought him in. Anil’s discovery had sent him into a deep personal crisis. He hadn’t expected it to be <em>real</em>. He’d been planning to publish his experiments with the <em>Ashtadhyayi</em>, but how are you supposed to tell an audience of computer scientists that Vedic mysticism is <em>real</em>? Eventually his company had suggested he try out a few mindfulness and meditation classes in Bangalore, just to take his mind off things, at their expense. That was where he met Swami Radha. Apparently the Joyousness Movement still sends out its members into the world, to find the last few Westerners dribbling into India in search of spiritual meaning, snatch them up and bring them to Parpakainilam, the fictional Indian state that doesn’t exist on any map—and Anil was a Westerner in need of spiritual meaning. I’d been doing it so wrong, he told me, I’d been treating this whole mystical tradition like a machine for me to open up and take apart, see all the pieces, like it’s all just lines of code… That’s not how it works. Swami Radha, she taught me that. You can spend a million lifetimes trying to understand it with your mind, but you never will. The only way is to experience it, to let go of your mind, let go of the thing that needs to understand, throw yourself into joy instead… You could let go in a second, Sam. I can <em>see</em> you, dude, I can see how hard you’re clenching to this thing you think is yourself, this mind with all its little thoughts, and all you need to do is relax your grip for <em>just one second</em> and you’ll wake up, you’ll understand everything…</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7eb5ed11-5d32-4ca2-a173-1e5469bdb2c9_1920x1270.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7eb5ed11-5d32-4ca2-a173-1e5469bdb2c9_1920x1270.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7eb5ed11-5d32-4ca2-a173-1e5469bdb2c9_1920x1270.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7eb5ed11-5d32-4ca2-a173-1e5469bdb2c9_1920x1270.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7eb5ed11-5d32-4ca2-a173-1e5469bdb2c9_1920x1270.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7eb5ed11-5d32-4ca2-a173-1e5469bdb2c9_1920x1270.jpeg" width="1456" height="963" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7eb5ed11-5d32-4ca2-a173-1e5469bdb2c9_1920x1270.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:963,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:760469,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7eb5ed11-5d32-4ca2-a173-1e5469bdb2c9_1920x1270.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7eb5ed11-5d32-4ca2-a173-1e5469bdb2c9_1920x1270.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7eb5ed11-5d32-4ca2-a173-1e5469bdb2c9_1920x1270.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7eb5ed11-5d32-4ca2-a173-1e5469bdb2c9_1920x1270.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>According to Anil, Swami Radha is something like a living saint. She was there, she was one of the first, she had actually <em>known</em> the Guru. A lot of people at the ashram had <em>seen</em> Guru Raj Hansi; before he went into seclusion they all used to spend hours a day just staring at his face and smiling, but Swami Radha had actually <em>known</em> him. They’d walked the streets of San Francisco together. Dropped acid together. Meditated, just the two of them, tuning into universal consciousness from a drafty garrett in the Haight with splinters in the floorboards and little grains of cat litter wedged in the cracks. Anil was deep into it, this heroic age in a distant century before he was born. He didn’t actually know anything about her. He didn’t even know her name.</p><p>Swami Radha’s name is Sarah Campbell, and she was Miss Norfolk 1963, Miss Virginia 1964, and the cause of the notorious upset at Miss America 1965. Her talent was poetry. Sarah and four of her friends had started calling themselves the Chesapeake Bay School of Poets, after the one in New York, after the one in Paris. In the grey Februaries they’d drive down to Virginia Beach to sit in empty ice cream parlours and agree that they were atheists. Then she would walk barefoot on the beach in the rain, with freezing water welling in her footprints, while the boys watched. The Chesapeake Bay School of Poets didn’t like the Beats, didn’t care for rock and roll, and wasn’t interested in segregation either way, but it did like to feel the absence of God in the world—in conversational but precisely metered verse—across the raging grey-bearded sea. Tom McWin had two poems published in the <em>Virginia Quarterly Review</em> at five dollars a line and one in the <em>Hudson Review</em> at three, which made him the most succesful of the Chesapeake Bay School. Charlie Ward had two poems in <em>Triangle</em> at ten dollars each, which made him the second most succesful. Sarah Campbell had one poem in the <em>Daughters of the American Revolution Poetry and Recipe Almanac</em>, which made her the third most succesful, and while they hadn’t given her any money at all it did make her Miss Virginia 1964. She knew the poem wasn’t much good, nowhere near her best work, safe, timid—</p><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text">Not that it matters,
A branch bowed over, a ditch in the turf, or my arm
Long and tanned, laid out on the table
For yours...</pre></div><p>—but you have no idea what it was like to read that poem on stage, looking down, so demure, in front of all the unknown thousands of red-blooded TV-watching Virginians who’d just seen her prancing around a stage in only a few vague scraps of swimsuit. How many people read the <em>Hudson Review</em>? And how many watched the pageant? She told herself the beauty contests were just a means of getting noticed for her poetry, but really she liked it. The Chesapeake Bay School of Poets were all nice, thoughtful boys, and their attempts to flirt with her all consisted of pretending not to notice she was beautiful while viciously criticising her scansion. The big swollen moustachioed men who ran Miss Virginia didn’t pretend not to notice that she was beautiful. They had the hunger in their eyes and didn’t hide it. Like an ape. She didn’t mind. She didn’t even mind getting fucked, which seemed to be an integral part of the whole process. It was very grown-up, very Parisian, very chic, wasn’t it, to have assignations in motel rooms, unspoken quid pro quos, to pour yourself all over the wheezing red-cheeked form of Mr Fred Jennings, senior vice-president of the Sun-Tone Swimsuit Corporation and unbiased judge. Whatever he thought, she was the one taking advantage of him. Penetrating <em>him</em>. Soaking in the squalor of his body, using it all. Everything is experience, and Sarah wanted to experience everything in the world. And when it happened Fred dealt with it very efficiently; he found a doctor and made the appointment and paid for it all, and all Sarah had to do was sit in a metal chair gripping the cold metal handrails tight as cold metal moved around inside her. It was only afterwards, sitting dazed on the boardwalk in Atlantic City as children screamed in each other’s faces and sunlight welled up from the ground, that she considered that perhaps Mr Fred Jennings had done this before. Suddenly the world felt very loud. The children were too loud and the sunlight was too loud, and over in the Boardwalk Hall, President Johnson was bellowing too loud under a huge portrait of dead President Kennedy. Usually when she went about the world little scraps of poetry arranged themselves in her head about everything she saw, but now she couldn’t think. So she wasn’t really thinking when, during the middle of the televised Miss America pageant, she produced a razor from inside her swimsuit and slit herself open, all the way from the base of her sternum down past her navel, and stood there unmoving, with a perfect smile, as the blood washed down her legs.</p><p>They had her in a hospital after that, which she dimly accepted. Everything was dim in there; every second was like being awoken from a nap. Tom McWin wrote a poem about the incident in which he vaguely suggested they’d slept together, which was published in <em>Poetry</em> at ten dollars a line. This marked his formal graduation from the Chesapeake Bay School of Poets, and by the time Sarah was out of the hospital, with her hair all brittle and her toes all bruised, Tom McWin had already decamped for New York. The rest of the School huddled around her and tried to cheer her up with all the gloomy things she used to like. Gloomy beaches, shuttered stores. She wasn’t interested any more. She wasn’t interested in experience, poetry, words, food, her body, or herself. She wanted to scrub them all out, most of all her body and herself. Wrists gone bony. She had become distressing to be around, so eventually, guiltily, they stopped. Sarah stayed in Virginia for another two months, and then she got on a bus to San Francisco. She’d heard that was where you went.</p><p>The city didn’t impress her. Hilly and drab, and all the people spouted nonsense, Buddha and Krishna and love. The Haight might have been dribbling in Day-Glo, but it still smelled like church. There was a new catechism, and America’s lost children were intoning it well, like the good choirboys they really were. But Sarah tried. She dropped acid at the Fillmore and had a truly horrible time. Lurked for hours in the sticky corners, with hideous tuneless music blaring all around, waiting for her mind to break out in candy-coloured streams of liquid joy—but it wasn’t happening. Why wasn’t it happening? What was wrong with her? This cold iron cage inside her brain, that even the magic drug couldn’t break. Her thoughts were wrong, she was thinking wrong, she could <em>feel</em> every single thought she was having and all of them were sour, nervous, joyless... What did it even mean? What even was it, this torture called consciousness, being exposed shelterless to this rain of thoughts? Fingertips buzzing. She crouched down. God, this was it, wasn’t it? This was the drug, this was what it did: it made her terrified of her own mind.  The only way out was to stop thinking. Don’t think, she thought. How can you think not to think without thinking? The roof of the Fillmore was the crown of her skull, and it was so dark inside, hot and bubbling, and there was no escape… And then, as she looked up in terror, the crowd parted for a moment and he was there. A blond god. He looked at her. I know you! he said. Wisps of pure white light were dangling from his hair. Snaking out between the buttons of his shirt. He knew her. He was a six foot tall American man and when he looked at her the white light coiled around Sarah’s arms and she thought absolutely nothing at all.</p><p>Everyone called him the blond god. He had dark, deep brown skin and a magnificent golden beard, and he was a miracle worker. Junkies came crawling to him over broken glass to bask in his smile, and afterwards they never touched the stuff again. He laid his hands on psychotic bums and they were healed. Once he gave a brief lecture before a small crowd of runaway teens from Chicago, and later all of them independently found twenty dollars on the street. His doctrine was strange. He taught that the only way to joyous liberation was through the ancient mystic practice of dhyana, or meditation, in which you achieve one-pointedness of mind until the mind itself vanishes into pure consciousness. But, he said, anything could be a form of meditation. For most people, the best form of meditation was to lose oneself in the rhythms of working a boring, square corporate job. To put on a flannel suit in the morning and drink a martini at night: this can be dhyana. To sit in church and think of nothing as the pastor drones through his sermon: this is dhyana. To join the army, go to Vietnam, and fight and die for your country: this is the greatest dhyana of all. The <em>Gita</em> calls it karma yoga, the yoga of action. To be in the pure experience of fighting and killing, strafing villages from a helicopter, without any attachment to your own life: get up, son of Kunti, bull among men, and shoot your arrows. The youth of America were bursting out in Day-Glo swirls, but the blond god was telling them to stop, to go back to the grey world, cut their hair and wear a tie—and they loved him. </p><p>He had arrived from somewhere. Shambhala, they said, the secret kingdom in the valleys of Tibet where the unborn Maitreya Buddha reigns. Agartha, the hidden city inside the hollow earth where the King of the World has his court. He had learned from the lost sages of Iram of the Pillars. He had come from California, the real one, the secret original, the magical island off the shores of Paradise Montalvo described in the <em>Sergas de Esplandián</em> five hundred years ago. But he didn’t have a home and he didn’t have a name. When he needed to sleep, he slept in the garrett Sarah Campbell rented with the last of her Miss Virginia money. As for the name… But you <em>must</em> have a name, Sarah told him. Before you were the great wise man, when you were a little boy running around in short pants, what did your mother call you? The blond god just smiled. Was that me? he said. I’m here. I’m in front of you now. Am I less myself because you don’t have a word for me? Are you still so obsessed with turning things into words? Yes, she said, serious now, yes, I want you to have a name. My name is Krishna, he said. Your name is Radha. He half-sang poetry she’d never heard:</p><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text">O Radha, you like the dark sky when the moon is waning
The newly blossoming blue lotus
The black deer
The dark tamala tree
The dark monsoon clouds
The dark Yamuna river 
Why, then, do you dislike charming Krishna 
Who is so like them in name and form? </pre></div><p>So Radha became her name.</p><p>He never touched her. Sex was useful for other people; it brought them into awareness of the body, which is not a container for the self but a pathway beyond it. The teenage girls he fucked on Radha’s splintering floor—that was a purely selfless act, to bring them into enlightenment. He and Radha didn’t need it; they were already there. They could just sit naked in front of each other in lotus pose, his magnificent cock straining upwards as he told her the secrets of the world. He said that they had known each other before, tens of thousands of times. Once he had been a proud white bull and she had been a cow. Once she had been a bumblebee and he had been a flower. Once they had been king and queen of the world. Every soul, he said, is born once in every kalpa. A kalpa is an age of the universe, and it lasts four point three billion years, after which the universe is destroyed by fire and blackness. In every kalpa the earth is the same, but the gods and the people are different. In the last kalpa, the State of California was a magnificent kingdom called Suvarnaparvatam, and the goddess Ganga chose to flow into the world through the Sierra Nevadas instead of the Himalayas, and the mouth of the Ganges was in the San Francisco Bay. The land remembers, and he did too. The two of them had lived in a palace of lotuses and fountains in Suvarnaparvatam, exactly where her cold and empty attic stood now. Some of the gods they worshipped, like Yuttam or Sveda, had got too jealous, and in this kalpa they were demoted to humanity. The great god Sveda was born as Napoleon Bonaparte, a mere conquerer of men. Each kalpa is a single day for four-headed Brahma, creator of worlds, and the four point three billion years of destruction and ruin that comes afterwards is his night. Brahma’s week is sixty billion years, and three trillion of our years are one of his. We are in the early afternoon on the first day of Brahma’s fiftieth year. He will live for one hundred years, and then even Brahma will die. And then what? said Radha. And then nothing, said the blond god. Then it’s like nothing ever existed at all. In the end, three hundred trillion years will have only been a blip. </p><p>But it didn’t take a hundred trillion years: between winter and summer something changed. Suddenly the blond god had a name. He was Guru Raj Hansi, which means the Laughing King, and his followers were the Joyousness Movement. There were thousands of them now, pouring into Golden Gate Park to sit and stare in rapture at him. So is that what I call you now? said Radha. Are you Raj? He pressed his palm to her forehead. I am you, he said. If she hadn’t been so totally in love she would have laughed in his face. Lately, during their meditation sessions, she’d started seeing the same thing she’d seen on LSD, tendrils of pure white light coiled in his beard and wriggling out of his collar, and sometimes his face seemed grander and sterner than human. And if the other members of the Joyousness Movement were seeing it too, maybe that explained why they were so eager to follow him to India. To sell everything they had and give all the money to this man without a name, so he could build a new community for them. It was part of their reintegration: before the Joy-Joys could come back to America to find liberation in data entry and television-watching, they would have to leave. Only Radha bothered to ask the boring questions. Where, exactly, are we going? India is s big place. Have you bought the land already? Don’t you need permits for this sort of thing? Is the Indian government aware of your plans? Are there any plans, or are you making this up as you go along? You’ll see, said the Guru. You’ll see. </p><p>Everyone at the White Hermitage Ashram knows the miracles that followed. How the Guru led eight hundred followers through trackless, tiger-haunted scrub, until they started to complain, there’s nothing here, we’re all going to die. But the Guru told them to kneel down, and press their faces deep into the dirt, and when they looked up there was an entire mountain range on the horizon that hadn’t been there before, and they were kneeling by the side of a freshly tarmacked road winding into the scrub. That was the first miracle. The second miracle came after they arrived in what even he seemed slightly surprised to discover was the fictional Indian state of Parpakainilam, hidden in the crease between Kerala, Mysore, and Madras. The Guru chose plot of land for the ashram, which was a muddy river valley full of wading ibises. He spent tens of thousands of rupees on construction equipment, huge earth movers and pile drivers, and when it arrived none of it worked. Just hunks of metal. You couldn’t even turn on the ignition. So the Guru had all the vehicles dragged by the side of the river, and then he had all the children, from toddlers up to fifteen-year-olds, stand in a semicircle around the heap of tractors, chanting and singing hand in hand for twelve hours from sunset to sunrise, and then afterwards everything worked perfectly. A few hundred former junkies, dropouts, and runaway girls built an entire functioning town in twenty weeks. That was the second miracle. </p><p>Only Radha saw the third miracle. The White Hermitage Ashram was an incredible success, for a while. People were streaming in from every corner of the world. Australian girls with big hanging freckled breasts, and little uncircumcised Frenchmen, and even a few severe Soviet engineering students who came down from their fraternal socialist study programme in Delhi, along the road to the fictional state of Parpakainilam. Rock stars came. Bankers came. At least one British MP, shifty-eyed, under a fake name. They spent a few months staring in ecstasy at the Guru, or sprawled out naked on the grass, fucking and being fucked by whoever happened to be within reach—and then they went home, to find meditative bliss in TV dinners. The Joyousness Movement was teaching the lost children of America, and they were learning. Far away, the Western world was becoming more attuned to pleasure. People were living joyously now; they no longer needed to come all the way to India to find out how. Gradually, over the years, the flood of pilgrims died down. Once they were gone. a few of the original Joy-Joys started walking back down the path from Parpakainilam and into the world, one by one, without saying goodbye, until there were barely a hundred left. Finally, on the first day of 1983, Guru Raj Hansi gathered the last of them together. If you are still here, he told them, you have not understood my teaching. I offered you the way out of your unhappiness, but you wouldn’t take it. You were more interested in mystical knowledge than ordinary happiness. There is no mystical knowledge. There is no secret. Since you don’t want to be happy, there is nothing more I can do for you, but you can still help me. Tomorrow, I will wall myself into my cell. I will never speak to any of you again. I will not look at you, and you will not look at me. Keep this ashram open for the last few unhappy people, the failures like yourselves. Stay here until I die, and then all of you will throw yourselves on my pyre. In the next kalpa, I will save you.</p><p>This is the third miracle. Radha watched and wept with the others as the Guru bricked himself into his cell. For ten years she knelt outside the walls, humming and singing sutras to the Guru, waiting for him to appear and explain the nature of this test. After ten years, she took an electric drill, bored a hole into the wall, and peered inside. There was no body. There was no Guru. He had vanished; he had dissolved into the air.</p><p>Radha left the ashram, but she couldn’t leave the Joyousness Movement. She didn’t know any other way to live. If she couldn’t throw herself on the Guru’s pyre, she would fulfil his last order. She would travel constantly around India to find the last few unhappy people, the failures like herself, still seeking, and bring them into the ashram. They weren’t hard to convince. She was fifty years old and still beautiful. Her breasts were still high and her legs were still long, even if the unhappy people still couldn’t help glancing at the red scar plunging down from the base of her sternum. But without the Guru, without the white light in his beard, she could feel her body disintegrating. She did an hour of yoga every day. She ate vegetables and sprouted grains. Still the skin started bunching up at her elbows, hanging loose over her belly. Fifty became sixty, seventy; now she was closing in on eighty. How long did she have to wait? Eight point six billion years until the next kalpa, until she was young again, and she and the Guru would live together in a palace of lotuses and fountains. But the last one, the young man in Bangalore, Anil: that was something different. He’d also come here from San Francisco; he was also trying to understand something beyond understanding. But San Francisco must have become a very different city, to be sending people like Anil. He said the whole place was about computers now. Little machines that fit in the palm of your hand: you look at them, and they instantly switch off all your thoughts. All you do is sit and scroll, and your mind disappears. A portable meditation machine. Incredible. Whatever seeds the Guru had planted there in California, they were bearing fruit. Anil told her that he was trying to make people offload more and more of their actual thinking to these machines. The machines will think, and the people will just sit and breathe. It was beautiful. She wasn’t sure she had anything to teach him, but she took him to the little room she rented in Shanti Nagar anyway, for a few educational sessions in the practice of joy. Sat him in siddhasana and delivered the usual second-hand bullshit about letting go of your mind and all your inhibitions. The first time she took off her clothes in front of him, he didn’t grimace. Something stranger. Instead of an old, sagging, liver-spotted woman, he saw a <em>woman</em>, naked, in front of him, and he was afraid. Terror radiated off him like a sunburst: this young man was a virgin. Somehow, after everything that had happened, America was making virgins again. He was still stammering nervously as she guided him inside her. Are you sure, he said, that this is part of it? Oh honey, said Swami Radha, no, this isn’t part of it. This is the whole damn thing. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9e4bdf-c5f1-42c4-bde8-33ec4c72f243_3951x2963.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9e4bdf-c5f1-42c4-bde8-33ec4c72f243_3951x2963.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9e4bdf-c5f1-42c4-bde8-33ec4c72f243_3951x2963.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9e4bdf-c5f1-42c4-bde8-33ec4c72f243_3951x2963.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9e4bdf-c5f1-42c4-bde8-33ec4c72f243_3951x2963.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9e4bdf-c5f1-42c4-bde8-33ec4c72f243_3951x2963.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ff9e4bdf-c5f1-42c4-bde8-33ec4c72f243_3951x2963.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3484325,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9e4bdf-c5f1-42c4-bde8-33ec4c72f243_3951x2963.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9e4bdf-c5f1-42c4-bde8-33ec4c72f243_3951x2963.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9e4bdf-c5f1-42c4-bde8-33ec4c72f243_3951x2963.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9e4bdf-c5f1-42c4-bde8-33ec4c72f243_3951x2963.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Swami Radha never learned Guru Raj Hansi’s name, but he did have one. In fact, he had several. A whole host of them appeared on the FBI’s most wanted list for sixteen years, from 1969 to 1985, in connection with hundreds of counts of fraud, along with the trafficking of over two hundred minors from the United States to India. It named him as Raj Hansi, with the aliases Jack Bryant, Philip Strangman, Neil Orn, Ronald John Wheeler, and Sam Blunkett. For sixteen years, the US Government attempted to extradite the Guru from India, while the Indian government claimed it wasn’t legally responsible for its fictional territories. Finally, based on intelligence that the Guru had walled himself into a cell and not been seen for several years, the FBI declared that Raj Hansi was most likely dead.</p><p>The consensus now is that the Guru’s real name was Jack Bryant, and he was born to Annie Bryant of St Louis, Missouri—unmarried, father unknown—on July 8th, 1924. This is not as significant as you think it is. It will not teach you anything about the man if I tell you about the bottle of gin his mother kept next to the bed, or the gentlemen friends who came by to beat him, or the boys who asked him with rocks in their hands if his father was a nigger. What you need to know is that he was judged white enough for the United States Navy, and in 1943 they posted him on a toenail clipping of a Pacific atoll which the Navy had named Bakersville Island, but the natives called Wai-Ino-Moeuhane-Ino, which means Bad-Water-Bad-Dreams, and in the glittering candy-blue lagoon in the middle of the atoll there was a downed Mitsubishi Zero with the corpse of the pilot still inside. None of the other boys on Bakersville Island wanted to swim in the creepy, corpse-polluted waters of the candy-blue lagoon, but weird Radarman 3rd Class Jack Bryant stripped off all his clothes and ran into the water, whooping loudly for attention. Down there he discovered that the Mitsubishi Zero had already become an outcrop of coral. White polyps were budding all along the fuselage, and red fronds lazily trailed its wings. Small translucent creatures skittering in and out of bullet holes on pale segmented legs. The pilot still sat in his seat. Barnacles studded his helmet, and behind the green fuzz on his goggles Jack could see the twisting flanks of the thing that had made its home in the hollow that was his eye. The pilot had a coral face and coral hands. Where the bullet had gone through his chest there were long green frills growing out of his jacket like a badge. He looked like a king in that cockpit, a sea-king on his sea-throne, resplendent in his barnacle crown, holding the sceptre of anemones that had been his throttle lever, as tiny glinting fishes came to bow and worship before him. </p><p>That Japanese pilot was Jack’s first master. Once his name had been Toshiyasu Aoyama. Before the war, he was a maths teacher in the village of Togo in Aichi Prefecture. He was strict; he’d thwack the boys with a bamboo stick when they forgot the order of operations. Not any more. Now he only had one lesson, which he taught without any violence, or any motion at all: that nothing exists except change. At night, in his bunk on the island of bad water and bad dreams, Jack returned to the halls of the Coral King. The palace of pearly illusions where eyes become eels. He thought: once I was a child. That child is not me. That child does not exist. One day I will be like that pilot. From the perspective of the future, I do not exist. Instead of a person, there’s just a series of actions, changes. When I wake up I will already be someone else. Sometimes in the night more Zeroes buzzed over Bakersville Island, and the anti-air cannons thudded thick bursts of red tracer fire into the sky. Jack lay on the sand as everyone rushed around in panic. If he wanted, he could pluck the Japanese fighters out of the sticky air and drown them in the lagoon.</p><p>People started liking Jack a lot more once he decided he didn’t exist. The other boys stopped leering at him. They played football on the beach together, and sometimes one of them would quietly offer to suck him off. He discovered, to his surprise, that he had developed a warm, open, confident personality. </p><p>When the war finally ended, to the sound of half a million frying Japanese, Jack moved around, selling things. There was suddenly so much to sell. He sold dictionaries, refrigerators, alarm clocks, vacuum cleaners, cigarette lighters, nylon stockings, canned ham, patent medicines, phonographs, porch paint, mousetraps, silverware, electric fans, fountain pens, folding chairs, handkerchiefs, linoleum tiles, ladies’ gloves, men’s ties, floor polish, box springs, doorbells, rubber boots, flashlights, paperweights, cigarette holders, cufflinks, baby rattles, fishing rods, compasses, toaster ovens, picnic baskets, cocktail shakers, baseball gloves, film projectors, raincoats, lampshades, suitcases, telescopes, garden shears, chessboards, hurricane lamps, shaving kits, spice racks, jigsaw puzzles, life insurance, model planes, hair tonics, barometers, sewing machines, and fly swatters. He sold them in Paragould, Blytheville, Jonesboro, Pine Bluff, Sikeston, Farmington, Marion, Carbondale, Centralia, Hopkinsville, Madisonville, Henderson, Dyersburg, Forrest City, De Queen and Kennett. He spent his nights in the Ozark Inn, the Dixie Delight Motel, the Razorback Rest Stop, the Pioneer Lodge, the Bootheel Court, the Delta Breeze Hotel, the Cardinal Crossing Palace, the Bluegrass Budget Lodge, the Riverbend Retreat, and the Cottonwood Hole. He ate bacon and eggs and biscuits and gravy and ham and coleslaw and pie. </p><p>Sometimes, over coffee and coleslaw at the Pioneer Lodge or the Riverbend Retreat, he would meet other salesmen. The other salesmen all seemed to be living on a different planet. They would set out for Henderson or Carbondale without knowing if they would make a single sale there. Their lives progressed from one slammed door to the next. It made them into taloned things, swooping, turkey-necked, desperate. What a miserable way to live, in such a beautiful country. People were always glad to see Jack, his sunshine smile, and his briefcase full of nylon socks. Except, of course, that there was no Jack, and no nylon socks either. Just a sourceless smiling and selling that circulated around the centre of an America that also did not exist. You could give that smiling any name you like. So when Jack drove west, out to the far side of the Missouri River, he tried selling something else. He tried selling Philip Strangman.</p><p>Philip Strangman was born in August 1928 to American parents in Porto Alegre, Brazil, where his father owned some cattle ranches. He grew up in a small grid of white houses with picket fences where ladies called on one another for tea, but outside the fence there was just the wide pampas stretching flat in every direction, and far away the tall clouds of dust the gaúchos left as they rode under an empty sky. Out there, there was no law except the one you made yourself. Every gaúcho had his facón, a long cruel knife he kept under his blanket, and on the first insult to his honour he would draw his knife, cut your throat, and continue like nothing had happened, and nothing had. Can you blame Philip for wanting to plunge into those wide, violent plains? And when he was old enough, he did. Set out alone on horseback into the world. Something happened out there, something Philip Strangman didn’t like to talk about; a Federal Policeman was dead. His father paid whoever he needed to pay, and packed Philip off to Yale. What emerged was a well-bred young man, heir to a substantial fortune, very literate, very urbane, but he was still tanned dusty-brown like a gaúcho, and he still had the wide-open pampas in him, an inner distance, the hundreds of miles where the wild horsemen ranged… And why was he here, in Kearney, Nebraska? To buy land, of course. To buy enormous tracts of land. All he had to do was sit through one night of screeching and wailing at the Kearney Opera House in a rented tux, and all the blue-eyed daughters of the local Mayflower aristocracy were intent on making his acquaintance, and their fathers wanted him too. Yes, they would be open to investing maybe two thousand dollars, and then we can see how things progress… It was incredible. You can tell someone your name is Philip Strangman and he’ll simply <em>believe</em> you. He’ll repeat it to his friends. George, this young man is Philip Strangman. Well, how do you do, Philip. And then later, when George’s debutante daughter is clawing at your shoulders in the back seat of your car, she’ll be whispering oh Philip, oh Philip, to the savage man of the pampas who does not exist. </p><p>A smiling and a selling and a fucking of Philip Strangman where it plained. In the desert there was smiling and selling and fucking Ron Wheeler. When it Texased the smiling and selling and fucking spoke the name Neil Orn. It all took place in a kind of sleep. He found it strange how little he remembered. Wheeler knew nothing about Strangman, and neither of them knew anything about Bryant. The money passed freely between them, but money is mute. Long ago he had swum down into the house of the Coral King, and never quite come up again. </p><p>It was like that for a decade, and for most of the next. In Philadelphia he was selling Sam Blunkett, a jumped-up California oilman who had the audacity to court the tedious, frigid, neurasthenic Marge De Grub, of the Old Philadelphian De Grubs. The rest of the De Grubs were repulsed by the cut of Sam’s suits, but they liked the soft, barely audible rustle of his money. They were no different from those salesmen living out of their briefcases out west. An eye to hunger and a beak to peck. So they let him sit by Marge’s bedside and press her hand if she’d let him, and sometimes he had to sit through visits from her doctors. Marge had taken amphetamines, electroconvulsions, and psychoanalysis, none of which had any particular effect; now the De Grubs had arranged a visit from Baron László Dőry, the world-famous Hungarian shaman. Embarrassing to be in the room with another fraudster, but what could he do? So in came the Baron with his wild dark beard and his white robes embroidered with runes, to dance and howl in front of Marge’s bed. But the whole time, the wild man kept shooting glances back at him. He knew, he<em> knew</em>, the motherfucker had rumbled him. And at the end, inevitable, the Baron greased himself over. Forgiff me, zir, but I could not help detecting zat ze energy field around you hass an extraordinary blockage… I belieff your very life may be in danger, zir. Allow me to prezent my card… </p><p>So he made the arrangements for Baron László to visit him at the Bellevue-Stratford, and prepared himself for the blackmail that was coming. No silly bedsheets when he arrived, just a sober dark suit. Preliminaries. You’re not a California oilman, said Baron László. His real voice was still from somewhere in Europe, but more compressed, precise. No, said Jack, and you’re not a Hungarian shaman. No, said the Baron, I am not. He studied Jack carefully. Nonetheless, he said the difference between you and me is is that I still know who I am. He peered closer. I wonder, is there still anyone in there? Watch it, buddy, said Jack. Very unusual, said the Baron. You have discarded your self, but you have not yet discovered your Self. Perhaps you have been in this hole for so long, you no longer remember that it is a doorway. Jack stood up. If this is a shakedown, he said, it’s the lousiest shakedown I’ve ever seen. Let’s say you tell Max Van Grub whatever you want, and I tell him whatever I want, and let’s see who he believes. For now, Baron, whoever you are, get the fuck out of my rooms. But the Baron didn’t leave. This is not a shakedown, he said. All I am saying is that you are asleep, and you must become wakeful. You need to wake up and stand here in this room, in this moment. Wake <em>up</em>! The Baron clapped his hands, and the sound was the loudest thing Jack had ever heard. Louder than a gunshot, louder than the anti-air batteries lighting up the night. He staggered back like he’d been slapped. What the hell was that? he said. A start, said the Baron. </p><p>Baron László Dőry was Jack’s second master. He said everything he knew had been passed down to him by Maurya, a ten-thousand-year-old priest who lived in the White Hermitage in the inaccessible hills of Parpakainilam. For four billion years the priests of the White Hermitage have safeguarded the secrets of the universe, but sometimes when the dharma is growing weak they descend from their hills to teach them again to the world. The price is that whoever descends from Parpakainilam becomes mortal. Jesus Christ had been a brother of the White Hermitage; so were Hermes Trismegistus, Mohammed, and Laozi. All earthly religions are a garbled imitation of the secrets of the White Hermitage, but since Parpakainilam is in India, the religions of India are a little less garbled than anywhere else. The baron asked Jack if he knew any philosophy. He didn’t, but he knew how to pretend. You will know, then, said the Baron, that all European philosophy begins with substance, form, and extension. It is the philosophy of the ruler, who has already numbered and apportioned his stocks of cattle and grain, and now wants to number and apportion all the visible and invisible worlds. It has very little to teach you. Indian philosophy is not the same. In India, philosophy begins with two things: consciousness, and the breath. Let me tell you a story. Once, long ago, there were a people called the Aryans, and they were fierce. They worshipped the gods of thunder and war, and they rode their chariots over the steppes of Asia, smiting whatever lay in their path. One day, the Aryans decided to invade the lands of India. Leap down from their bright and lively highlands, into the slumbering Gangetic plain. Pounce, sword in hand, on the tillers. Bludgeon them to death in the fields. So they burned their way down into the muddy depths of India, until at last they entered Parpakainilam. The White Hermitage had no swords or chariots, but they did have Maurya. He faced down a hundred thousand Aryan warriors and defeated them with six words. The words he spoke were these. <em>Tvam chetanah. Tvam atra. Idam idanim. </em>You are conscious. You are here. This is now. In an instant, the Aryans became aware of their own minds. They were the first people to become awake. And this is how I will wake you. I will teach you to be here, now. First I will show you how to breathe…</p><p>Between learning to breathe, learning to sit, and learning to think about nothing, the Baron was very happy to let Jack keep pursuing the damp, bedridden Marge De Grub. In fact, he insisted on it. Jack and Marge, he said, were two portions of Manu, first of the Aryans, whose body was divided between his sons Ikshvaku and Ila. After Manu died the race was split, but Jack was a son of Ikshvaku, and Marge was a daughter of Ila. The Age of Aquarius was here; their son would be a terrible lord, ruler of the entire earth. This made Jack uneasy. Did he really want to impregnate the wan and wilting Marge? Was he entirely convinced that either Marge De Grub or half-black Jack were the direct descendents of Manu, first of the Aryans? In fact, he wasn’t sure about a lot of Maurya’s revelations. Did he accept, as the White Hermitage taught, that all the Caucasian races ultimately descended from glowing, genderless beings that lived on the island of Atlantis? He had done some extracurricular research, and it didn’t help that the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> had somehow forgotten to include an entry on Parpakainilam. The place was also absent from the indices to <em>The Indian Empire: Its People, History, and Products</em> by William Wilson Hunter, <em>The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians</em>, edited by Henry Miers Elliot, and <em>An Advanced History of India</em> by R.C. Majumdar, H.C. Raychaudhuri, and Kalikinkar Datta. Meanwhile, the Baron, who paid for his dinners by wearing a white robe and gibbering nonsense at children in wheelchairs, insisted that through the practice of controlled breathing he had learned to levitate, see the past and future, and move objects with his mind. Jack had been a salesman for a long time. Could he really not tell when something was being sold? </p><p>One morning, Sam Blunkett left the Bellevue-Stratford, leaving an unpaid bill and twelve empty suitcases behind. When night came, the lights of Akron were glowing against the clouds. It felt good to be on the road again, behind the wheel of a car, formless and nameless, hot potential and nothing else. Too many lost months, mouldering in old hotels by the rusty Atlantic, facing and aping the baron-ravaged ruins of Europe. He wanted the Ozark Inn and young dumb pussy. He wanted the great rolling body of America, and he knew how to get it. It would have a use, everything he’d learned. Out on the other coast, people were trying to wake out of the world. He would show them how. He’d do it the right way. He knew what people really wanted, what really made them happy. He’d sell them dictionaries, refrigerators, alarm clocks, vacuum cleaners, cigarette lighters, nylon stockings, canned ham, patent medicines, phonographs, porch paint, mousetraps, silverware, electric fans, fountain pens, folding chairs, handkerchiefs, linoleum tiles, ladies’ gloves, men’s ties, floor polish, box springs, doorbells, rubber boots, flashlights, paperweights, cigarette holders, cufflinks, baby rattles, fishing rods, compasses, toaster ovens, picnic baskets, cocktail shakers, baseball gloves, film projectors, raincoats, lampshades, suitcases, telescopes, garden shears, chessboards, hurricane lamps, shaving kits, spice racks, jigsaw puzzles, life insurance, model planes, hair tonics, barometers, sewing machines, fly swatters, sex, transcendence, and a smile. </p><p>Jack Bryant died in Palm Beach on September 1st, 2012. His death was recorded under the name Jack Meringola. Until the end, he never wondered how he managed to be at exactly the right place, at exactly the right time, with exactly the right tools, to reshape the world. He never wondered how he could wave away the walls of his cell at the White Hermitage Ashram like they were made of someone else’s dreams. His estate was valued at sixty-one million dollars. The State of Florida seized it all.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e200e2f-3657-4a6a-a594-ef7f859522a2_3652x2739.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e200e2f-3657-4a6a-a594-ef7f859522a2_3652x2739.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e200e2f-3657-4a6a-a594-ef7f859522a2_3652x2739.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e200e2f-3657-4a6a-a594-ef7f859522a2_3652x2739.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e200e2f-3657-4a6a-a594-ef7f859522a2_3652x2739.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e200e2f-3657-4a6a-a594-ef7f859522a2_3652x2739.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1e200e2f-3657-4a6a-a594-ef7f859522a2_3652x2739.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2924304,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e200e2f-3657-4a6a-a594-ef7f859522a2_3652x2739.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e200e2f-3657-4a6a-a594-ef7f859522a2_3652x2739.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e200e2f-3657-4a6a-a594-ef7f859522a2_3652x2739.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e200e2f-3657-4a6a-a594-ef7f859522a2_3652x2739.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>And Baron László Dőry, the mysterious fraud who started it all—who was he? A hunted man, exiled from his country, living under an invented name. But crank the wheel back and let’s begin again. Look for a village in the green valleys, look for a slight and serious child. While the other boys are out having adventures, he’s reading about adventures in a book. He’s not a baron: his father paints signs. He’s not Hungarian either. But he reads about barons and dukes, the conquests of Árpád, shamans on the taiga, lost kingdoms, savage magic, demon gods. He imagines new countries. Draws the outlines of islands in the margins of his copybook, hot fantastic islands full of brown-breasted natives, where he is king. Or exotic mountain fortresses, hidden away from the rest of the world. Its name is Parpakainilam. Who has time for games with balls? The world is so big, and the one inside his head is even bigger. </p><p>Even when he becomes a man, a student of philology, he doesn’t abandon that wide inner world. He writes down the history and doctrines of exotic Parpakainilam, land of hills where the White Hermitage hides. The words aren’t his own, of course. He got them from a traveller, who transcribed them from his interviews with the great master Maurya, keeper of the secrets of the universe. He circulates them around a few small interested circles, and suddenly they’re everywhere, passed around, hand to hand. Something new is happening: the young people want to live differently, spiritually. They’re willing to follow anything that smells like the ancient mystics of the east. And so we end up here. On the other side of the world, Jack Bryant is diving into the hall of the Coral King; here, the man sits on a hill overlooking a ravine. We’re in the slushy end of winter, when spindly trees slump in the half-frozen mud, and hundreds of people are walking, naked, to the edge of the ravine. Parents clutching their children. Squat old women, hobbling. Scrawny young men who walk with one hand over their genitals, still ashamed. Others huff into their fists against the cold. Once they arrive they only have a moment to look down into the ravine and see the broken white shapes inside, open mouths half-clogged with dirt. A terrible wail as they realise what’s about to happen to them, and then the soldiers machine-gun them and their bodies fall into the ditch. Another mass of people is driven to the lip of the ravine. It’s been happening like this all day, and when the sun rises tomorrow it will start again. </p><p>SS-Obergruppenführer Otto Träumann sits on his hill as a hundred thousand people are exterminated below. He is in padmasana, hands half-open on his thighs. Long slow exhalations steam around his face, and he wears an armband above his saffron robes, marked with the swastika of the chariot-riding Aryans who were the first people to become awake. Träumann watches the massacre, and notes the feeling of disgust and sympathy and sometimes pleasure as they rise to the surface of his consciousness. Not following them, not suppressing them either, not judging. But sometimes even the great yogi, initiate of the White Hermitage in far Parpakainilam, finds it hard to keep his head entirely clear of thoughts. Something is fizzing in there. The war is already lost, but the war is just a prelude. The twenty-first century is being born inside his brain.</p>

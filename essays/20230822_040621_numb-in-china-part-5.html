Back then, it was very ordinary for Europeans to write a lot of drivel about the inscrutable Oriental mind and its mysterious concept of ‘face.’ Today, we know that there is no national character, not really, just offensive stereotypes; the human material is the same everywhere. (There’s a particular vision of the Italian character, for instance—but the first Italian person I knew socially was a pale, shy economics student.) But might we have gone too far in the other direction? What is it like to grow up in China, with Mao and Confucius each trying to govern your upbringing? How does China’s very long and very particular history repeat itself in the individual? And what happens when you try to break out of it? Who are the Chinese? What are they like?</em></p><p><em>From now until September, Numb at the Lodge will be in China, investigating these questions and more.

The gentle browsing ursids crawl over every building in the city; I saw a huge one halfway up the enormous luxury mall in Chunxi Road, but there are more on avenues and side streets, dangling from balconies with their heavy claws. When you drive into a tunnel, you’re likely to see a few pandas there too, congregated in the darker corners, faces looking hollow and hungry under the orange lights. Normally solitary and retiring, here the pandas barge into small shops and hang around the aisles. They linger in the restaurants. Families of them occupy the city squares, apparently unbothered by the crowds that mill around them taking photos. A whole tribe of pandas—hundreds of them, maybe thousands—seems to have taken over Chengdu East Railway Station. It’s hard to go ten seconds in this city without spotting, somewhere, the heaving sloping back and gentle black-and-white face of a giant panda.</p><p>These pandas are, I guess, not <em>actual</em> giant pandas in the usual sense of the term. Just pictures of them. But I’m not sure how long the distinction will really be viable. Right now, there are about two thousand giant pandas alive in the world. But you can see twice as many in a single Chengdu city block. In other Chinese cities, they have public-order notices illustrated with a smiling cutesy cartoon policeman. In Chengdu they have those too, except <em>the policeman is also a panda</em>. In shopping centres there are statues of disturbingly skinny pandas on two feet, grinning and wearing human clothes. I walked past a shop that had an enormous crowd outside, all jostling to get in. Some local delicacy, I thought, or maybe a very hip fashion outlet, something like that. Nope. The place sold nothing but giant fluffy pandas, fluffy panda keychains, fluffy panda phone cases, fluffy panda baseball caps, panda hoodies, panda glasses cases, panda ashtrays, and other products of a generally ailuropodine nature. People were rushing to the counter with their arms full of tat, hastily scanning the WeChat QR code, and then flinging it all out the window to their waiting families in frenzied glee. I think—I can’t be sure, but I <em>think</em>—I saw a Communist Party mural in which Mao appeared as a gently smiling giant panda. Buying and selling images of pandas appears to be this city’s primary economic activity; I imagine that all the huge glass skyscrapers that dot Chengdu seemingly at random are occupied solely by companies that manufacture images of pandas, distribute images of pandas, or speculate on microfluctuations in the value of images of pandas on the Chengdu Simulacrum Exchange (CSX). Maybe the actual pandas could go extinct without anyone noticing, since almost every panda that’s ever existed is now an image.</p><p>Chengdu is, famously, China’s most chilled-out, vibey major city. The locals take after their animal mascots; they’re friendly and gentle, they don’t like to work too much, they’re not in any hurry, and when possible they spend the whole day eating. As if they’d built this teeming megalopolis full of skyscrapers by accident. But it’s true: the flyovers in Chengdu are all wreathed in nice greenery, and it was here that I saw my first Chinese person with dreadlocks. This was at Jah Bar, a tiny sweaty drum &amp; bass club by the river. The two Chengduvians (?) who’d kindly offered to show us around were annoyed that their favourite place, a late-night vinyl club called Funkytown, wasn’t open. This was because Chengdu happened to be hosting the games of the 2023 Universiade. I think if most cities found themselves suddenly hosting thousands of student athletes, the bars would open even later than normal. But here, the Party decided that it wanted to impress these young, hot, endorphin-filled men and women with how <em>orderly</em> the city is. So no Funkytown. But no matter. Chengdu is still a beautiful place. </p><p>Before Jah Bar, we sat in a tiny wine shop, and our hosts smoked cigarettes and talked about sex. Chinese men, they said, were totally not feminist and cared too much about work. But Western men, especially the ones in China, were basically fuckboys who say they’re interested in something serious but only ever text you at one in the morning, asking if you’re up. If you sleep with a Chinese man he’ll think you’re basically married. But if you sleep with a Western man you might never see him again. One of our hosts was a lawyer, another worked for a big American firm—but she was bored of the corporate life, she wanted to travel. Friends kept popping in to talk about their trips to Europe. It all felt a lot like home.</p><p>In Chengdu, the side streets are full of small, beautifully decorated bars, where the beers are brewed in big tanks out back and the cocktails approach London prices. You can sit on a miniature plastic chair in the street and eat some of the best noodles you’ve ever had in your life. In the afternoon, after it rains, the water still drips out of hundreds of gutters, cascading from rooftop to rooftop, its gentle tapping, the lush wet air of a steamy utopia. There are loads of pretty little vintage stores where my girlfriend browsed through the kitschy earrings and 60s dresses. But that was the part that made me feel weird. What does <em>vintage</em> even mean in China? None of those dresses were from here; they’d all been bought up abroad and flown in. (This is why vintage shopping in China is not particularly cheap.) Here, the 1960s didn’t involve any groovy colourful clothes. Just year after year of mobs and torture and beatings and famine and death. </p><p>It’s very hard to square the violence of China’s recent past with the Chinese people I meet in the present. Right now, in Europe and America, they’re terrified of China and its one-point-four billion Chinese, its runaway growth, its designs on the world. What are the Chinese after? What do they want? But when you spend any amount of time here, the answer is obvious. What the Chinese want is a fuzzy keychain in the shape of a giant panda. What else could there possibly be?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49930af0-ce6b-4e4e-af1a-917c93906662_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49930af0-ce6b-4e4e-af1a-917c93906662_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49930af0-ce6b-4e4e-af1a-917c93906662_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49930af0-ce6b-4e4e-af1a-917c93906662_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49930af0-ce6b-4e4e-af1a-917c93906662_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49930af0-ce6b-4e4e-af1a-917c93906662_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/49930af0-ce6b-4e4e-af1a-917c93906662_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:330794,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49930af0-ce6b-4e4e-af1a-917c93906662_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49930af0-ce6b-4e4e-af1a-917c93906662_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49930af0-ce6b-4e4e-af1a-917c93906662_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49930af0-ce6b-4e4e-af1a-917c93906662_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Chengdu is maybe the most liberal, Westernised city I’ve visited in China so far. But even here, China is not the West, and Chinese people are not the same as Westerners. Some small observations, in no particular order:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Heat (1): </strong>As a young, starry-eyed Anglo moron visiting this country for the first time, you will notice that it’s followed a very different civilisational path as soon as you sit down at a restaurant. Like anywhere else in the world, they will serve some water for your table. But it doesn’t matter how sweaty and stifling the day may be: the water will be hot. Almost everyone in China appears to believe, with absolute certainty, that even a tiny sip of refreshing ice-cold water will catastrophically restrict the flow of qi through your body, tightening the pores in your skin, stiffening your joints, causing terrible pain in your stomach, and potentially killing you. Cold is yin, which puts it alongside darkness, clouds, the moon, bitterness, pussy, and the underworld. Heat is yang, along with light, clear skies, the sun, sweetness, dick, and the living: all good wholesome things. Strangely, though, Chinese people will still happily drink cold beer and cold Coca-Cola: the principles of Chinese medicine don’t seem to apply when it comes to Western products. One of our hosts in Chengdu told us that she was the more traditionally Chinese of the two: she was a little quieter and more reserved, and she wouldn’t drink cold water.</p></li><li><p><strong>Heat (2):</strong> There are some hot countries where the people seem perfectly fine with their climate; they regard sweating spluttering foreigners with gentle amusement. China is not one of those places. Wherever I’ve been here, the locals have clearly struggled with the heat as much as I have. They’ve developed two major systems of amelioration. For men, this involves hiking your tshirt over your belly and strutting around with your midriff pushed out, possibly to maximise its surface area for more efficient heat loss. Women, meanwhile, will often wrap themselves in a <em>Dune</em>-style stillsuit, or a breathable gore-tex niqab. Everything is covered except the eyes, and sometimes they wear sunglasses too, with a parasol for good measure. I have no idea if all this synthetic fabric actually keeps the heat off, but it does block the sun. China has yet to discover tanning; pale is still beautiful. And this does produce some weird racial neuroses. An expat in Beijing told me how one of his Chinese friends once admired his skin, and said she wanted hers to be as pale as his was. But while he’s a white guy, he has a generally olivey Mediterranean complexion; she was, in fact, <em>already</em> much paler than him. It didn’t matter. White people are existentially paler, and therefore more beautiful, in a way that has nothing to do with the actual colour of their skin.</p></li><li><p><strong>Music:</strong> Jah Bar was a surreal place. The DJs played some jungle, and then some skittery tracks from the geekier end of garage, and then something with some wobbly LFO filters: the exact kind of music I used to go out to in Leeds about a decade and a half ago. But something had changed between Yorkshire in the late 2000s and Sichuan in the early 2020s, and it wasn’t just my age: eventually it struck me that <em>none of these people were on drugs</em>. Even in Chengdu, where you’d really expect them to, nobody so much as smokes weed; it’s around, but only foreigners are interested. Electronic music without drugs: form without content. Maybe relatedly, Chinese taste in Western music is <em>weird</em>. In one of Chengdu’s beautifully hip little bars, where the cocktails were great and abstract paintings hung on the walls, they were playing Sting’s <em>Fields of Gold</em>. In the lobby of our little boutique hotel, they had soft plinking piano versions of Christmas carols, plus <em>Greensleeves</em> and the <em>Godfather</em> theme. Later, we met a man who owned a store selling artsy nude Ren Hang-style prints by his photographer friends and magazines brought over from Hong Kong. His favourite band was East 17, the 90s boyband from Walthamstow. He proudly showed us his East 17 tattoo. His second favourite band was Cradle of Filth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Noise:</strong> Chinese people have an incredible tolerance for the stuff, at levels that make me want to trepan myself out of sheer frustration. A few weeks ago, I was on a bus to a big tourist site. The bus was equipped with one of those alarms that sounds unpleasantly if someone hasn’t buckled their seatbelt. About half an hour before we arrived, the bus paused next to something that looked like a car park and we all got out of our seats; then it started trundling along again and we all sat back down. But not everyone put their seatbelts on again. For the next thirty minutes, we sat through a constant chirping alarm and nobody did anything to stop it. Then, when we arrived, it transpired that next to every drinks stand and souvenir stall, of which there were many, the owners had propped up a megaphone, automatically barking some sales patter every twelve seconds. ‘Hot coffee! Hot tea! Cold beer! Take a breath! Take a break!’ The ancient site was utterly awash with noise. Next to some old stone steps, a policeman was holding another megaphone. He did nothing; the megaphone yelled the Mandarin for <em>be careful on the stairs</em> on a constant loop. Because there was quite a dense scrum to clamber up the stairs in question, getting there required hearing this message so many times it started to assume a percussive, rhythmic quality; sometimes, when I close my eyes at night, I can still hear that vocal drumbeat echoing in my broken frazzled brain. But nobody else seemed to mind. On a train, a middle-aged man looked happily out the window while his phone blared out a one-and-a-half fragment of some social media video, failed to load the rest, and then started over, repeating for several hours. I’m told that until quite recently, many towns in China still had public loudspeakers that screamed automated propaganda at the residents all day; people simply learned to mentally tune it out. Chinese culture has traditionally put a high premium on silence and tranquillity; maybe this was always the point. Tranquillity is not a shaded bamboo garden where even the insects lie still; it’s being able to stand in line for an hour while a recorded voice repeats the same words over and over again without ever losing the deep silence within.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fb8b42-1a11-47a3-a821-a00236f9a7b8_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fb8b42-1a11-47a3-a821-a00236f9a7b8_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fb8b42-1a11-47a3-a821-a00236f9a7b8_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fb8b42-1a11-47a3-a821-a00236f9a7b8_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fb8b42-1a11-47a3-a821-a00236f9a7b8_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fb8b42-1a11-47a3-a821-a00236f9a7b8_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5fb8b42-1a11-47a3-a821-a00236f9a7b8_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:346801,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fb8b42-1a11-47a3-a821-a00236f9a7b8_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fb8b42-1a11-47a3-a821-a00236f9a7b8_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fb8b42-1a11-47a3-a821-a00236f9a7b8_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fb8b42-1a11-47a3-a821-a00236f9a7b8_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><ul><li><p><strong>Religion (1):</strong> If you know one of those people who keeps saying that they don’t like <em>organised religion</em>, but they do like Buddhism, because Buddhism is not really a religion at all, it’s just a more mindful approach to life, it’s just about spirituality and techniques for attaining wisdom and inner peace—if you know one of those, tell them to climb Mount Emei. It’s only a few hours from Chengdu by train, but Emeishan is the highest of China’s Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains and the site of the country’s first Buddhist monastery, set right at the point where the fertile Sichuan basin starts climbing into the Tibetan Plateau. At the top, your most annoying friend will find an enormous golden statue of the bodhisattva Samantabhadra, with ten faces, riding a four-headed elephant with twenty-four tusks. In the temples, they’ll see that pilgrims don’t sit in silence, meditating; they just bow before a statue of the Buddha or one of his friends, drop a few yuan on the altar, and take their karmic reward. In the monasteries, six monks sit at their desks, belting out sutras in rhythmic unison while one of them keeps time with a bell. This basically mechanical motion will also accumulate karma. It’s an organised religion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Religion (2):</strong> But the Chinese attitude to religion still <em>feels</em> very disorganised. You can do stuff associated with Buddhism or Taoism or Confucianism without in any sense belonging exclusively to what we in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic world would call a <em>faith</em>. The usual term for the general soup of cults and practices that’s dished out here is <em>Chinese folk religion</em>, but all the name means is that Chinese people will worship anything that moves, and most things that don’t. At my Jewish primary school I was taught that everyone who wasn’t Jewish worshipped idols; that Christians would make something—a table, a chair—and then bow down before it, saying <em>O great chair, you created the Universe</em>. Then I got a little older and learned that my teachers had lied; nobody really worships idols, other religions just don’t have our strict rules on images of the divinity as loci of devotion. But there’s no getting around it: the Chinese <em>do</em> sort of worship idols. There are temples devoted to the heroes of the <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em>. Any Confucian scholar with a few good aphorisms is liable to be resurrected in fibreglass and given offerings of incense, money, and plastic-wrapped cookies. In one Chinese folktale, a man’s wife and daughter are eaten by a river monster, so he goes to the river and kills it with a crucible of molten iron. Afterwards, the locals build a statue of the man and—while he’s still alive—worship it as a god. Those that do so always have good luck. If it’s there and it seems powerful, why not prostrate yourself before it? Worship is cheap. You may as well. </p></li><li><p><strong>Faces:</strong> This might be difficult to quantify, but younger and older people here <em>look different</em>. The line seems to be somewhere in the mid-1980s. If you were born before then, you’ll set your face in the ordinary, dignified way people have set their faces throughout human history. But Chinese people under 40—in the big cities, at least—look like Americans. (In the same way that all French people have the same <em>look</em> about the mouth and lower face, regardless of their ethnic origin. Maybe speaking French exercises certain jaw muscles. Maybe it’s just too much sneering.) These faces are open, plastic, they overemote. Instead of displaying the face in its full abyssal quality, the unrepresentability of the subject which is the seat of all ethics, Americanised faces flit between five or six exaggerated, preprogrammed expressions. The most famous is the blank, neutral American smile. (This one is best expressed by their politicians: even for a western European like myself, it is <em>bizarre</em> to see Ilhan Omar grinning like a madwoman through all her TV appearances. But she does it for a reason; if she spoke solemnly, with gravitas, like her warrior-poet Somali ancestors, the Americans would start to feel a strange fear creeping up their spines. In normal countries, meanwhile, someone who smiles all the time is assumed to be mentally subnormal.) But there are others: the puffy-cheeked huff, the smug eye-roll with the chin pointed up, the eyebrows of amusement. What underlies all this is the idea that the face ought to act as a giant billboard, advertising your inner state, with the same clichés as all advertising: that you should want total strangers to know how you feel. I think the real shift in China came when children started watching cartoons: instead of the subtle, <em>human</em> movements in their elders’ faces, they learned to emote from flat, simplified, iconic characters. Chinese kids watch a lot—a <em>lot</em>—of godawful cartoons, most of which appear to have been devised by algorithm. Some are designed to mimic the appearance of fiddling around on a parent’s phone, down to the weird imitation loading screens that pop up between scenes. They have joined the First World, which is the land of the cartoon-men.</p></li></ul><p>Still, even though older Chinese people don’t overemote, that doesn’t mean they’re cold or unfriendly; they don’t smile, but they do laugh. Some people are are funny: Irish, Russians, Nigerians, Jews. Others are simply not. The Australians, with their mean mirthless guffawing, might be good to laugh at, but they are not actually funny; only an Australian could briefly revolutionise stand-up comedy by not being funny. The Dutch are not funny. The Japanese are extremely not funny. (On that note—in a bizarre attempt to please my girlfriend, I agreed to watch <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> with her this holiday. (Much later, it turned out that she’d never actually asked me to do any such thing.) Several people whose opinions I respect have praised this thing, and I have absolutely no idea why. I don’t mind that the animation is basically a slideshow. I do mind that every single line of dialogue falls into one of three types. In the first, disembodied voices say things like ‘Engage thruster drive three’ and ‘Thruster drive three engaged, sir!’ In the second, a lone disembodied voice says things like ‘The next train to Giga-Kyoto will depart from platform three, please head to platform three for the next train to Giga-Kyoto.’ In the third, two of the most annoying voices imaginable gibber over the tits of a fourteen-year-old girl. It is all such unimaginable dreck, so utterly unserious but still marked by such a void of wit or humour that it feels like suffocating to death in some nerd’s sweaty bedroom filled with mouldering jars of cum.) But the Chinese are a funny people. </p><p>Basically every public interaction that isn’t outrightly hostile is marked by a sense of pervasive good humour. Sometimes the terseness of the language can make this hard for foreigners to discern. Chinese people can sound angry, even when they’re not. On one bus journey, I thought I heard the driver and a few of the passengers engaged in an all-out row, with the driver going on a long, vituperative rant at the end—but when we reached our destination they all suddenly laughed and started chatting amicably and offering each other cigarettes: it had all been some brilliant joke. People in China can see the joke in everything. It’s nice. Being among people here is nice.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4cdfff5-8145-40e0-ae8f-0d513ec59264_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4cdfff5-8145-40e0-ae8f-0d513ec59264_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4cdfff5-8145-40e0-ae8f-0d513ec59264_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4cdfff5-8145-40e0-ae8f-0d513ec59264_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4cdfff5-8145-40e0-ae8f-0d513ec59264_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4cdfff5-8145-40e0-ae8f-0d513ec59264_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e4cdfff5-8145-40e0-ae8f-0d513ec59264_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:558852,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4cdfff5-8145-40e0-ae8f-0d513ec59264_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4cdfff5-8145-40e0-ae8f-0d513ec59264_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4cdfff5-8145-40e0-ae8f-0d513ec59264_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4cdfff5-8145-40e0-ae8f-0d513ec59264_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In the end, my impression of the Chinese is that they are, on average, some of the nicest, kindest, most welcoming people I have ever met anywhere in the world. But obviously my position is slightly biased. I’ve only been in the country a few weeks, and anyway I’m a tourist here, a novelty, and people tend to behave differently around guests. It’s difficult to generalise from my standpoint. Several times each day, my girlfriend and I are stopped by a smiling Chinese woman with her children shyly clinging to her legs. She wants to know if she can take a photo of us with her kids. As soon as her phone’s out, the kids are suddenly grinning, sticking up v-signs. Some people find this sort of thing annoying, but we’ve been absolutely charmed by it. Still, it’s probably not the case that Chinese people are doing this with <em>each other</em>. We need a witness for the prosecution, a Satan: someone to point out all the unpleasant features of life in China that visitors might not see. And there’s been plenty of racist material written on the Chinese national character—but in the same way that no antisemite will ever be able to rant against the Jews with as much hatred and insight as we rant against ourselves, I don’t think there’s any better witness than someone who is themselves Chinese. So I choose Bo Yang. </p><p>Bo Yang led an interesting life, but not in a very nice way. He was a member of the Chinese Nationalist Party during the civil war, and fled to Taiwan with the rest of the party after the Communists won. Afterwards, he wrote essays and poems for the Chinese Youth Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps, but Bo Yang was always too crabby  and weird to be anyone’s propagandist. He started opining that something was badly wrong with not just Chinese Communism, but Chinese culture in general, even with the Chinese people. So the state cracked down. One of Bo Yang’s gigs was translating <em>Popeye</em> comics into Chinese for Taiwan newspapers; the government decided that one strip, in which Popeye buys a private island and immediately votes himself President and King, was a veiled mockery of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. He was accused of being a communist saboteur, tortured, and jailed for nearly a decade. His time in Taiwanese prison didn’t do much to improve Bo’s opinion of the Chinese national character. In 1985, after his release, he published <em>The Ugly Chinaman</em>, a collection of essays excoriating his countrymen. (He insisted on that title for the English translation.) The book sold well in Taiwan and Hong Kong, but it was a sensation on the Chinese mainland. In 1988 Bo Yang returned there for the first time; he was mobbed by adoring fans, this prophet who would save the Chinese people from themselves. Very shortly afterwards, the book was banned. Today, nobody here has even heard of him.</p><p>For Bo, everything ugly about the Chinese is a product of the culture of the soybean paste vat. ‘When I grew up in North China,’ he explains, ‘there were fermentation vats used for making bean sauce in every home. If you’ve ever eaten Peking duck, you've had the sauce: a thick paste made primarily out of soy beans and wheat flour. It's as viscous as mud, and doesn't flow, the very opposite of the surging waves of the Yellow River. Because the paste remains in the vat untouched and unstirred, and because the water content is constantly evaporating, the paste grows thicker and thicker as time goes by. Chinese culture undergoes a similar process.’ Five thousand years of civilisational continuity, slowly fermenting. You can add anything you like to the vat—Buddhism, Marxism, even liberal democracy—it’ll just melt into the sludge. ‘A fresh peach placed in a vat full of putrescent soy paste will soon wither away and turn into a turd.’ But the main ingredient is Confucianism: the doctrine that tells you to cringe before your parents, cringe before political authority, cringe before the traditions and rituals of the past, to preserve this gift of dark thick paste that’s been rotting for so many lifetimes, and never try to change anything, never try to think for yourself…</p><p>The people whose minds are formed in this airless vat are, Bo claims, universally ugly: filthy, noisy, petty, vicious, cynical, cruel, crude, selfish, cowardly, envious, fickle, toadying, bickering, self-aggrandising, self-pitying, and impolite. ‘Because Chinese have never had much self-respect, it is immensely difficult for them to treat others as equals. There are two alternatives: either you are my master, or my slave.’ Nobody can think beyond their own narrow interests: Bo imagines a Chinese person working on an atomic reactor, who needs one very particular screw to put the whole thing together. But his colleague in charge of the screws isn’t in his office. ‘He's off playing mahjong. Why is he playing mahjong today? Because you and he don't get along, and he doesn't give a damn if your atomic reactor never gets built. ‘Let it blow up,’ he says, ‘who cares?’’ </p><p>But when Bo visits the United States, he suddenly finds himself in a different world. American politicians don’t insult each other, or dig up dirt on their opponents’ private lives; if they even tried, an outraged electorate would boot them out of office. American companies never try to cheat their customers, and all business is done in an atmosphere of fairness and honesty. The Jews, who the Chinese have the temerity to compare themselves with, might sometimes disagree with each other, but they never interminably bicker among themselves. In Israel, everyone is impeccably polite. Americans never so much as brush against each other without both parties instantly apologising, whereas in China both would accuse the other of maliciously colliding with them and eventually start brawling on the street. If you’re taking a photo, American passersby will halt dead in their tracks to avoid walking into your shot; if you repeat the gesture for them, they’ll thank you profusely. Most of all, Bo is absolutely confounded by the mysterious Western Way of the Door. In China, you open a door and walk through it: perfectly rational. And for a while, he did the same thing in America. Friends tried to correct him, but he brushed them off. ‘I came to the United States as a tourist, not as a doorman.’ But then, just once, he tried holding it open for the person behind him, and before long he had become addicted to ‘the exquisite pleasure of hearing the tender echo of an old woman’s ‘Thank you’ in my ears.’ But when he got back to China, things were different. ‘I continued to open doors the American way but gave it up after only three days. No, my mind had not deteriorated. Every time I held a door open and stood back to let someone pass, those honourable descendants of the Yellow Emperor gave me a look that suggested they had a three-day-old turd stuck in their throat. Not a single person said ‘Thank you’ to me. So I went back to my old habit of letting the door swing wildly, unconcerned with whether the idiot it smacked in the face lived or died! I resigned myself to the fact that the only way to pry a simple ‘Thank you’ out of a Chinese mouth was with a set of dentist's tools.’</p><p>What Bo is arguing here is that China is what sociologists call a <em>low-trust society</em>. In a high-trust society, like the possibly fictional America he visited, interpersonal conduct is governed by abstract, mutually agreed-upon norms. You will slightly inconvenience yourself—by, for instance, holding a door open for a total stranger—secure in the knowledge that other people will happily do the same for you. In a low-trust society, the prevailing opinion is that strangers are mostly out to rob or cheat you, or possibly to fuck your children. Interpersonal conduct is governed by kinship relations: you can trust your extended family; other people, not so much. Low-trust societies tend to be poor and endemically corrupt with weak social institutions, and to have a lot of trouble getting rich.</p><p>But while anyone who turns against his own brothers is a brother of mine, I’m not sure Bo Yang is entirely right here, at least not any more. </p><p>There are, it’s true, a lot of aspects of Chinese society that fit the low-trust model. As a British person, the most shocking difference is the total lack of any taboo on pushing in front of people in a queue. Doing anything in China usually requires standing in line for several hours, but these lines are not static; each is a constantly jostling river, surging back and forth as absolutely everyone tries to sidle past everyone else, with the result that they usually get through in exactly the same order they started in. As a Jew, I can play this game with the best of them—but my girlfriend, whose ancestors have trudged across the island of Britain since they wore woad, usually ends up baffled and bedraggled somewhere at the far end of the line, with an elbowing mass of Chinese people blocking her path. </p><p>Other low-trust behaviours are much grimmer. In China, if you accidentally kill a pedestrian with your car, you have to pay compensation to their family—but if you only injure them, you might be on the hock for potentially unlimited medical bills. So if a driver hits a pedestrian, they will sometimes deliberately try to kill them. Before every inch of the country was covered by security cameras, this was very common. In one incident, not far from here in Sichuan, a truck driver knocked down a five-year-old boy. But the boy was only briefly dazed; he stood up and had started walking again when the truck driver reversed into him and drove over his head, killing him. In Guangdong, a two-year-old girl was hit by a car in 2011. At least eighteen people walked past her as she lay in the road, bleeding to death. Nobody tried to help.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f90ce0-d849-4307-841a-b4facefe085d_1280x960.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f90ce0-d849-4307-841a-b4facefe085d_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f90ce0-d849-4307-841a-b4facefe085d_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f90ce0-d849-4307-841a-b4facefe085d_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f90ce0-d849-4307-841a-b4facefe085d_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f90ce0-d849-4307-841a-b4facefe085d_1280x960.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/88f90ce0-d849-4307-841a-b4facefe085d_1280x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:360596,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f90ce0-d849-4307-841a-b4facefe085d_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f90ce0-d849-4307-841a-b4facefe085d_1280x960.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f90ce0-d849-4307-841a-b4facefe085d_1280x960.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f90ce0-d849-4307-841a-b4facefe085d_1280x960.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>People do, it’s true, love the pandas. After a while in Chengdu, I finally went to see them in the flesh, and afterwards I was a mess. Those gentle silly faces, lazily eating bamboo in the twilight of the species. Tears started welling in my eyes. They don’t <em>know</em> they’re endangered, I sobbed. They’re just so perfectly harmless and good. They don’t know what we’ve done to them. I stared at my hands. We were given such an extraordinary planet, I said, and all we’ve done is <em>kill</em> every other living thing here. I started talking about how I was a liberal environmentalist now, how I was going to stop swearing at every George Monbiot column in the <em>Guardian</em> and start donating to Greenpeace. We need to save the pandas, I said, fuck politics, fuck liberation, it’s the only thing, the <em>only thing</em> that matters. So I get why the Chengduvians have plastered their entire city with images of the animals. But living animals are rarely loved as much as their images. I also desperately want to save the pangolin, and the pangolin is being trafficked to extinction because its scales are prized in Chinese traditional medicine: dried, roasted, powdered, and boiled in boys’ urine, to cure hysterical crying, inflammation, malaria, or deafness. China only removed pangolin scale from its pharmacopoeia—the list of state-approved medicines—in 2020. It’s still widely available. Some of the planet’s weirdest and most beautiful creatures are being exterminated because there are people in China who’d rather have a time-honoured traditional inflammation treatment that doesn’t even work.</p><p>All this behaviour might have bubbled up from the deepest layers of soybean paste, but China’s more recent history may as well have been engineered to generate a low-trust society. Political turmoil is not good for trust-formation. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution might have presented itself as an attempt to finally drain the soy paste vat and all its accumulated centuries of rotting Confucian slurry, but Bo Yang describes it as ‘one vast Chinese family feud,’ and he has a point. Suddenly, you have the power—the <em>duty</em>—to denounce your annoying neighbour as a counter-revolutionary capitalist roader, at which point he’ll be stripped, humiliated, and possibly beaten to death. In fact, if you don’t do this, he’ll probably do it to you. A generation grew up knowing that everyone they met was a potential accuser, and it didn’t take much to become vulnerable. In 1968, Mao was given a crate of mangoes by the foreign minister of Pakistan; not knowing what to do with them, he gifted them to a group of factory workers. The mango became an inviolable symbol of the new dispensation; mangoes sealed in wax or preserved in formaldehyde were paraded like relics throughout the country. In one town, a local dentist was overheard saying the mango was not so special; it just looked like a sweet potato. He was arrested, found guilty of counter-revolutionary activity, and driven through town on the back of a truck as an example. Then, at the edge of the town, he was executed with a single shot to the head. </p><p>Things have changed since then, though: the Communist Party is now attempting to build a high-trust society by fiat. Practically all their street propaganda involves the idea of 文明, civilisation. ‘Build a civilised urban area: the whole society pays attention to the healthy growth of minors.’ Outside a school: ‘Civilised teachers, civilised students, talk about civility, civilised school.’ Above urinals all over the country, a gentle admonition to stand closer to the porcelain and not piss all over the floor: ‘向前一小步文明一大步,’ which is somewhat clunkily rendered as ‘A small step forward one step civilisation.’ What civilisation seems to consist of is helping old people across the street, gently encouraging children’s healthy self-expression, not bearing grudges against your neighbours, and smiling and saying thank you when someone holds open a door for you. This is obviously an utterly ridiculous way of reforming society, which is why it’s genuinely shocking how well it seems to have worked. </p><p>China doesn’t really seem to fit anywhere in the high-trust/low-trust binary. A lot of everyday behaviour seems to indicate a low level of social trust—but at the same time, opportunistic crime is basically nonexistent, economic growth is continuining (even with the recent real-estate crisis), institutions are strong, and the self-reported levels of trust are extremely high. One study found that 79% of Chinese agreed that most people in society are basically trustworthy, putting them one point ahead of Sweden and eight points ahead of Canada. Maybe you could put it in Bo Yang-ese: the Chinese are such thoughtless selfish suck-ups that as soon as someone more powerful tells them to <em>stop</em> being thoughtless selfish suck-ups—they <em>do</em>.</p><p>All I really have is anecdote. On the train to Chengdu, we found ourselves sat next to a Chinese person in the old mould: a decidedly unfriendly face, one which kept hacking and spitting into a plastic cup. But about halfway through the trip, a woman sat behind us exchanged a few words with him and then placed her baby in the old man’s lap. Immediately he started doting on the child, stroking her sparse hair, playing little games. Ah, we realised: he was the grandfather. The baby kept reaching for my face, and soon the grandfather and I were good friends, sharing clown duties with this tiny girl who laughed at the mere sight of our faces. It was a lovely experience. And then our train arrived at Chengdu: the woman got off with her daughter, and the grandfather stayed put. It turned out he wasn’t the child’s grandfather after all, just a totally random old man who happened to be on the same train. I can’t think of anywhere else in the world where something like that might happen. Only in China.</p>
